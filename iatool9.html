  <h1>Senderismo: A Short Story</h1>

  <section>
    <p>
      The trail begins at dawn, when the mountains are quiet and the air feels untouched.
      I hike here <b>always</b> with the same ritual: slow steps, steady breath, and eyes
      fixed on the path unfolding ahead.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <p>
      At first, every rock and tree seems the <b>same</b>, repeating itself like a rhythm,
      but with each turn, the landscape starts to shift in subtle ways I didn’t expect.
    </p>

  <section>
    <p>
      I <b>take</b> my time climbing higher, feeling how the effort stretches my legs and
      thoughts alike, as if the mountain is asking for patience before revealing anything.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <p>
      The trail grows <b>long</b>, winding through shadows and light, and somewhere along
      the way, the noise of everyday life fades into silence.
    </p>

    <p>
      By the summit, I realize the real <b>change</b> isn’t in the view below, but inside me:
      each hike reshapes how I move through the world, one step at a time.
