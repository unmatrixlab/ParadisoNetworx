Yeah.\n\n165\n00:11:09,933 --> 00:11:13,436\n-Which is not conventionally considered\na best practice.\n\n166\n00:11:15,505 --> 00:11:17,740\nI agree that the best practice...\n\n167\n00:11:18,041 --> 00:11:19,609\n-I'm certain that's the best practice.\n\n168\n00:11:19,742 --> 00:11:23,546\nIt's not conventional, but I am certain\nit's the best practice.\n\n169\n00:11:27,450 --> 00:11:31,254\nAnd by the end of this,\nI'm going to convince all of you\n\n170\n00:11:31,354 --> 00:11:33,456\nto have 60 people on your direct reports.\n\n171\n00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:35,491\n-The floor is yours.\n\n172\n00:11:36,626 --> 00:11:38,661\n-The reason... first of all,\n\n173\n00:11:38,761 --> 00:11:43,833\nthe reason is because the layer of\nhierarchy in your company really matters.\n\n174\n00:11:43,933 --> 00:11:46,202\nInformation really matters.\n\n175\n00:11:46,302 --> 00:11:51,107\nI believe that your contribution to...\n\n176\n00:11:51,241 --> 00:11:56,179\nthe work should not be based on the\nprivileged access to information.\n\n177\n00:11:57,280 --> 00:12:02,352\nI don't do one-on-ones and I don't...\nMy staff is quite large,\n\n178\n00:12:02,952 --> 00:12:06,022\nand almost everything that I say,\nI say to everybody all at the same time.\n\n179\n00:12:06,589 --> 00:12:08,324\nAnd the reason for that is because\n\n180\n00:12:08,591 --> 00:12:11,661\nI don't really believe there's any\ninformation that I operate on,\n\n181\n00:12:11,794 --> 00:12:15,131\nthat somehow only one or two people\nshould hear about.\n\n182\n00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:17,900\nAnd these are the challenges\nof the company\n\n183\n00:12:18,001 --> 00:12:19,068\nor this is the problem\nI'm trying to solve,\n\n184\n00:12:19,168 --> 00:12:21,237\nor this is the direction\nwe're trying to go into.\n\n185\n00:12:21,337 --> 00:12:23,039\nThese are the new endeavors.\n\n186\n00:12:23,139 --> 00:12:24,907\nThis isn't working. That's working well.\n\n187\n00:12:25,008 --> 00:12:29,946\nAnd so all of this type of information\neverybody should be able to hear it.\n\n188\n00:12:30,046 --> 00:12:33,650\nI love that everybody is\nworking off of the same song sheet.\n\n189\n00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:37,253\nI love that there is no privileged access\nto information.\n\n190\n00:12:37,353 --> 00:12:40,890\nI love that we're able to all contribute\nto solving a problem.\n\n191\n00:12:41,024 --> 00:12:44,560\nAnd when you have 60 people in a room\nand oftentimes...\n\n192\n00:12:44,661 --> 00:12:47,830\nWell my staff meetings are once\nevery other week,\n\n193\n00:12:47,930 --> 00:12:51,701\nand it's all based on issues,\nwhatever issues we have.\n\n194\n00:12:51,801 --> 00:12:54,404\nEverybody's there working\non it at the same time,\n\n195\n00:12:54,504 --> 00:12:58,041\neverybody heard\nthe reasoning of the problem.\n\n196\n00:12:58,174 --> 00:13:01,911\nEverybody heard the reasoning of the\nsolution. Everybody heard everything.\n\n197\n00:13:02,011 --> 00:13:04,847\nAnd so that empowers people.\n\n198\n00:13:04,947 --> 00:13:07,317\nI believe that when you give\neverybody equal access to information,\n\n199\n00:13:07,417 --> 00:13:11,287\nit empowers people.\nAnd so that's number one, empowering.\n\n200\n00:13:11,387 --> 00:13:19,028\nNumber two,\nif the CEO's direct staff is 60 people,\n\n201\n00:13:19,162 --> 00:13:21,230\nthe number of layers you've\nremoved in a company\n\n202\n00:13:21,331 --> 00:13:24,167\nis probably something like seven, \ndepending on how it is.\n\n203\n00:13:24,267 --> 00:13:26,869\n-60 at every layer, or only 60?\n\n204\n00:13:26,969 --> 00:13:33,509\nAs in, if I'm one of the fortunate 60,\ndo I also have 60 direct reports?\n\n205\n00:13:33,609 --> 00:13:37,013\n-No. I also don't think\nthat that's scalable downward.\n\n206\n00:13:37,113 --> 00:13:42,185\nAnd the reason for that is because\nyou need more and more supervision,\n\n207\n00:13:42,318 --> 00:13:45,421\ndepending on certain levels.\n\n208\n00:13:45,521 --> 00:13:48,658\nAnd at the E-Staff level,\n\n209\n00:13:48,758 --> 00:13:52,095\nif you're so unfortunate to be serving\non NVIDIA's E-Staff,\n\n210\n00:13:52,195 --> 00:13:57,600\nit's very unlikely\nyou need a lot of managerial.\n\n211\n00:13:57,700 --> 00:14:02,839\n-And so I rarely find myself having \nto stand up for conventional wisdom.\n\n212\n00:14:02,939 --> 00:14:05,842\nBut if I were to kind of steel mine\nthe other side, I'd say, well,\n\n213\n00:14:05,942 --> 00:14:08,411\none-on-ones are where you\nprovide coaching,\n\n214\n00:14:08,511 --> 00:14:11,614\nwhere you maybe talk through goals\ntogether, personal goals,\n\n215\n00:14:11,748 --> 00:14:13,883\ncareer advancement, what have you.\n\n216\n00:14:14,183 --> 00:14:17,220\nWhere maybe you give feedback\non something that you see somebody\n\n217\n00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:18,888\nsystematically not doing\nso well and so forth.\n\n218\n00:14:18,988 --> 00:14:20,990\nSo there's all these things\nthat kind of one is, again,\n\n219\n00:14:21,124 --> 00:14:23,826\nconventionally supposed to do\nin the one-on-one.\n\n220\n00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:26,629\nDo you not do those things or \ndo you do them in a different way?\n\n221\n00:14:26,796 --> 00:14:29,932\n-Really good question. \nI do it right there.\n\n222\n00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:32,335\nI do it right there.\n\n223\n00:14:32,802 --> 00:14:35,505\nI give you feedback right there\nin front of everybody.\n\n224\n00:14:36,439 --> 00:14:39,375\nAnd in fact, this is really a big deal.\n\n225\n00:14:39,709 --> 00:14:43,713\nFirst of all, feedback is learning.\nFeedback is learning.\n\n226\n00:14:43,813 --> 00:14:47,283\nFor what reason are you \nthe only person who should learn this?\n\n227\n00:14:47,950 --> 00:14:50,620\nNow you created the conditions\n\n228\n00:14:51,387 --> 00:14:54,991\nbecause of some mistake that you made\n\n229\n00:14:55,158 --> 00:15:01,230\nor silliness that you brought\nupon yourself.\n\n230\n00:15:04,734 --> 00:15:07,570\nWe should all learn from that opportunity.\n\n231\n00:15:07,703 --> 00:15:10,473\nSo you created the conditions,\nbut we should all learn from it.\n\n232\n00:15:10,606 --> 00:15:12,375\nDoes that make sense?\n\n233\n00:15:12,475 --> 00:15:15,211\nAnd so for me to explain to you\nwhy that doesn't make sense\n\n234\n00:15:15,311 --> 00:15:18,581\nor how I differ from it--\nhalf the time I'm not right--\n\n235\n00:15:18,714 --> 00:15:21,818\nbut for me to reason through it\nin front of everybody\n\n236\n00:15:21,918 --> 00:15:24,353\nhelps everybody learn how\nto reason through it.\n\n237\n00:15:24,454 --> 00:15:29,592\nAnd so the issue-- the problem I have with\none-on-ones and taking feedback aside\n\n238\n00:15:29,692 --> 00:15:32,929\nis you deprive a whole bunch\nof people that same learning.\n\n239\n00:15:33,029 --> 00:15:36,499\nLearning from mistakes,\nother people's mistakes,\n\n240\n00:15:36,599 --> 00:15:37,767\nis the best way to learn.\n\n241\n00:15:37,867 --> 00:15:40,937\nWhy learn from your own mistakes?\n\n242\n00:15:41,037 --> 00:15:43,139\nWhy learn from your own embarrassment?\n\n243\n00:15:43,239 --> 00:15:44,807\nYou got to learn from other\npeople's embarrassment.\n\n244\n00:15:44,907 --> 00:15:48,244\nThat's why we have case studies.\nIsn't that right?\n\n245\n00:15:48,344 --> 00:15:52,215\nWe're trying to read from other people's\ndisasters, other people's tragedies.\n\n246\n00:15:52,315 --> 00:15:54,383\nNothing makes us happier than that.\n\n247\n00:15:56,352 --> 00:16:00,723\n-Have you succeeded in getting other\nleaders at NVIDIA to adopt this practice,\n\n248\n00:16:00,857 --> 00:16:02,258\nor is that difficult?\n\n249\n00:16:02,391 --> 00:16:05,061\n-I give people the opportunity\nto decide for themselves,\n\n250\n00:16:05,161 --> 00:16:07,396\nbut I really discourage one-on-ones.\n\n251\n00:16:07,497 --> 00:16:09,031\nI really discourage one-on-ones.\n\n252\n00:16:09,131 --> 00:16:13,302\nNothing is worse than\nthe idea that somebody says,\n\n253\n00:16:13,402 --> 00:16:16,672\n\"Oh, Jensen wants us to do this.\"\n\n254\n00:16:16,772 --> 00:16:20,109\nWhy does that have to be said to anybody?\nEverybody should know.\n\n255\n00:16:20,209 --> 00:16:25,281\nOr somebody said,\n\"That E-Staff said that.\"\n\n256\n00:16:25,381 --> 00:16:27,483\nNothing drives me nuttier than that.\n\n257\n00:16:28,718 --> 00:16:34,023\n-You once told me that you really didn't \nlike firing people and very seldom did it.\n\n258\n00:16:34,123 --> 00:16:35,791\nCan you elaborate on that?\n\n259\n00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:40,930\n-Well, I'd rather improve you\nthan give up on you.\n\n260\n00:16:41,030 --> 00:16:44,700\nWhen you fire somebody,\nyou're kind of saying--\n\n261\n00:16:45,334 --> 00:16:47,436\nWell, a lot of people say,\n\n262\n00:16:47,570 --> 00:16:51,974\n\"It wasn't your fault\" or\n\"I made the wrong choice\" or--\n\n263\n00:16:52,108 --> 00:16:55,111\nThere are very few jobs--\nLook, I used to clean bathrooms,\n\n264\n00:16:55,244 --> 00:16:59,148\nand now I'm a CEO of a company,\nI think you could learn it.\n\n265\n00:16:59,248 --> 00:17:01,417\nI'm pretty certain you can learn this.\n\n266\n00:17:01,517 --> 00:17:04,287\nAnd there are a lot of things in life\nthat I believe you can learn.\n\n267\n00:17:04,387 --> 00:17:06,455\nAnd you just have to be given\nthe opportunity to learn it.\n\n268\n00:17:06,556 --> 00:17:09,425\nI had the benefit of watching a lot of\nsmart people do a lot of things.\n\n269\n00:17:09,559 --> 00:17:12,328\nI'm surrounded by 60 people. \nThey're doing smart things all the time.\n\n270\n00:17:12,428 --> 00:17:14,397\nAnd they probably don't realize it,\n\n271\n00:17:14,497 --> 00:17:17,066\nbut I'm learning constantly from\nevery single one of them.\n\n272\n00:17:17,166 --> 00:17:21,904\nAnd so, I don't like giving up on people\nbecause I think they could improve.\n\n273\n00:17:22,004 --> 00:17:24,774\nAnd so there's a--\nit's kind of tongue-in-cheek--\n\n274\n00:17:24,874 --> 00:17:29,545\nbut people know that I'd rather\ntorture them into

I start every conversation with\nwhat I deeply believed\n\n495\n00:30:49,945 --> 00:30:54,416\nand they believed it \nbecause they saw me deeply believe it.\n\n496\n00:30:54,516 --> 00:30:55,751\nAnd I reasoned about it.\n\n497\n00:30:55,851 --> 00:30:59,521\nIt wasn't like it was a spreadsheet,\n\n498\n00:30:59,621 --> 00:31:01,423\nand therefore you've\ngot to believe the spreadsheet.\n\n499\n00:31:01,556 --> 00:31:03,525\nThey had to believe the reasoning,\nthe words.\n\n500\n00:31:03,658 --> 00:31:06,962\n-How long did it take it to start working?\n\n501\n00:31:09,865 --> 00:31:12,534\n-Probably ten years, yeah.\n\n502\n00:31:13,368 --> 00:31:15,103\nIt wasn't that long.\n\n503\n00:31:16,304 --> 00:31:18,640\nTen years.\nIt comes and goes.\n\n504\n00:31:18,874 --> 00:31:21,109\n-Ten years.\n-Less than a third of your tenure.\n\n505\n00:31:21,209 --> 00:31:24,012\n-Yeah, it comes and goes.\nI barely remembered it.\n\n506\n00:31:24,112 --> 00:31:26,281\nThe suffering, I barely remembered it.\n\n507\n00:31:26,381 --> 00:31:31,486\n-Could NVIDIA be as successful\nin AI without Cuda?\n\n508\n00:31:31,586 --> 00:31:33,054\n-No, impossible.\n\n509\n00:31:33,188 --> 00:31:38,693\nIt is potentially one of the most\nimportant inventions in modern computing.\n\n510\n00:31:38,794 --> 00:31:41,430\nWe invented this idea called\naccelerated computing,\n\n511\n00:31:41,530 --> 00:31:46,968\nand the idea is so simple\nbut deeply profound.\n\n512\n00:31:47,235 --> 00:31:50,071\nIt says the vast majority...\n\n513\n00:31:50,172 --> 00:31:54,309\na small percentage\nof the code of programs\n\n514\n00:31:54,409 --> 00:31:59,648\noccupies, consumes, 99.999%\nof the runtime.\n\n515\n00:31:59,748 --> 00:32:03,118\nAnd this is true for a lot of\nvery important applications.\n\n516\n00:32:03,218 --> 00:32:07,222\nAnd that small little kernel,\n\n517\n00:32:07,322 --> 00:32:12,794\nor some several kernels,\ncan be accelerated.\n\n518\n00:32:12,894 --> 00:32:16,031\nIt's not all just parallel processing.\n\n519\n00:32:16,131 --> 00:32:17,199\nIt's not as simple as that.\n\n520\n00:32:17,332 --> 00:32:20,202\nBut the idea is that\nwe can take that kernel,\n\n521\n00:32:20,302 --> 00:32:22,103\nthat piece of software,\nthat part of the software,\n\n522\n00:32:22,204 --> 00:32:24,339\nand accelerate the living daylights\nout of it.\n\n523\n00:32:24,439 --> 00:32:27,142\nAnd today, when Moore's Law\nhas run its course\n\n524\n00:32:27,275 --> 00:32:33,482\nand CPU scaling is basically stopped,\nand if we don't accelerate every software,\n\n525\n00:32:33,582 --> 00:32:37,018\nyou're going to see extraordinary\ncomputation inflation.\n\n526\n00:32:37,118 --> 00:32:39,254\nBecause the amount of computation\nthe world does\n\n527\n00:32:39,354 --> 00:32:40,956\nis doubling every year still,\n\n528\n00:32:41,089 --> 00:32:43,658\nand yet if CPUs\nand general-purpose computers\n\n529\n00:32:43,758 --> 00:32:46,461\nare not increasing in performance\nbecause it stopped,\n\n530\n00:32:46,595 --> 00:32:47,963\nthen what's your alternative?\n\n531\n00:32:48,063 --> 00:32:50,832\nYour cost of computing is going\nto keep going up exponentially.\n\n532\n00:32:50,932 --> 00:32:53,468\nAnd so the time has come\nfor us to do that.\n\n533\n00:32:53,568 --> 00:32:56,438\n-So everyone here runs a business and...\n\n534\n00:32:56,705 --> 00:32:58,073\n-Accelerate everything!\n\n535\n00:32:58,173 --> 00:32:59,674\n-And you heard it here first.\n\n536\n00:32:59,774 --> 00:33:04,513\nAnd probably everyone has\nsome version of Cuda\n\n537\n00:33:04,613 --> 00:33:09,284\nor a thing that they think really\nmakes sense for the sector\n\n538\n00:33:09,384 --> 00:33:12,220\nor makes sense for their\ntechnology or what have you,\n\n539\n00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:15,023\nbut where the market doesn't see it yet.\n\n540\n00:33:15,323 --> 00:33:19,628\nDo you think it's possible to extract any\nkind of generalizable principles around\n\n541\n00:33:19,761 --> 00:33:23,198\nwhen you should really doggedly\ntrust that vision,\n\n542\n00:33:23,298 --> 00:33:25,834\nand when perhaps it's\nworth reconsidering\n\n543\n00:33:25,934 --> 00:33:28,103\nin a fashion that we could\nextrapolate from,\n\n544\n00:33:28,236 --> 00:33:30,939\nin the case of Cuda and other\n\"Cudas\" that have existed over\n\n545\n00:33:31,072 --> 00:33:32,140\nthe course of NVIDIA's history?\n\n546\n00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:38,079\n-Yeah.

So let's talk about about AI.\n\n581\n00:35:42,237 --> 00:35:44,639\nI'm going to just do some math\nto ground things here.\n\n582\n00:35:44,773 --> 00:35:46,808\nLet's just say that the total,\n\n583\n00:35:46,941 --> 00:35:53,281\nsort of compute capacity of all\nGPUs in the world today is X.\n\n584\n00:35:53,381 --> 00:35:56,151\nWhat do you think...\n\n585\n00:35:56,251 --> 00:36:02,624\nWhat multiple of X will\nwe be at in five years?\n\n586\n00:36:04,426 --> 00:36:08,697\n-First of all, you know that I'm going\nto regret saying this.\n\n587\n00:36:09,731 --> 00:36:10,999\nAnd this is be...\n\n588\n00:36:11,099 --> 00:36:14,402\nI'm a public company, you crazy person.\n\n589\n00:36:16,037 --> 00:36:22,010\nHow nice is it to be private?\n\n590\n00:36:29,250 --> 00:36:31,186\n-Safe to say considerably more.\n\n591\n00:36:32,053 --> 00:36:35,890\n-Well, let's reason about it, shall we?\nOkay. So let's let's reason about it.\n\n592\n00:36:35,990 --> 00:36:37,759\nLet's reason our way through okay.\n\n593\n00:36:37,859 --> 00:36:39,828\nSo first of all, it goes like this.\n\n594\n00:36:39,928 --> 00:36:43,431\nThe world has installed about\na trillion dollars worth of data centers.\n\n595\n00:36:43,665 --> 00:36:47,902\nThose trillion dollars worth of data\ncenters use general-purpose computing.\n\n596\n00:36:48,002 --> 00:36:50,705\nGeneral-purpose computing\nhas run its course.\n\n597\n00:36:51,172 --> 00:36:53,541\nWe cannot continue to process that way.\n\n598\n00:36:53,641 --> 00:36:57,846\nAnd so the world is going to accelerate\neverything, data processing, you name it.\n\n599\n00:36:57,946 --> 00:36:59,981\nAnd so we're going\nto accelerate everything.\n\n600\n00:37:00,081 --> 00:37:02,484\nWhen we accelerate everything,\nevery single data center,\n\n601\n00:37:02,617 --> 00:37:05,453\nevery single computer\nwill be an accelerated server.\n\n602\n00:37:05,687 --> 00:37:10,391\nWell, there's about a trillion dollars \nworth of computers if we don't grow at all\n\n603\n00:37:10,492 --> 00:37:13,895\nover the next four years that\nwe have to replace.\n\n604\n00:37:13,995 --> 00:37:16,498\nFour years, six years, \npick your number of years.\n\n605\n00:37:16,598 --> 00:37:20,435\nBut if the computer industry continues\nto grow at some 20% or so,\n\n606\n00:37:20,735 --> 00:37:24,272\nwe'll probably have to replace, over the \ncourse of next, pick your number of years,\n\n607\n00:37:24,405 --> 00:37:28,643\nabout $2 trillion worth of computers\nwith accelerated computing.\n\n608\n00:37:29,144 --> 00:37:32,046\nSo just make that GPUs, okay?\n\n609\n00:37:32,147 --> 00:37:34,215\nThat's number one.\nAnd this is the second part.\n\n610\n00:37:34,315 --> 00:37:38,787\nThis is the reason why,\nall of you, Stripe,\n\n611\n00:37:38,887 --> 00:37:42,123\nyou're onto something\njust absolutely monumental.\n\n612\n00:37:42,223 --> 00:37:48,696\nThis idea called, and you've heard me say\nan industrial revolution,\n\n613\n00:37:48,797 --> 00:37:50,231\nLet me tell you why.\n\n614\n00:37:50,331 --> 00:37:52,634\nWe are producing something\nfor the very first time\n\n615\n00:37:52,734 --> 00:37:55,003\nthat has never been produced before.\n\n616\n00:37:55,103 --> 00:37:57,572\nAnd we're producing it in\nextremely high volume.\n\n617\n00:37:57,705 --> 00:38:00,575\nAnd the production of this \"thing\"\n\n618\n00:38:00,675 --> 00:38:03,344\nrequires a new instrument\nthat never existed before.\n\n619\n00:38:03,444 --> 00:38:05,313\nIt's a GPU.\n\n620\n00:38:05,547 --> 00:38:08,416\nAnd the thing that we're producing\nfor the very first time,\n\n621\n00:38:08,516 --> 00:38:11,219\nfor the mathematicians and all the\ncomputer scientists in the room,\n\n622\n00:38:11,352 --> 00:38:14,589\nfor all of you, you know that\nwe're producing tokens.\n\n623\n00:38:14,756 --> 00:38:20,228\nWe're producing floating point numbers at\nhigh volume for the first time in history\n\n624\n00:38:20,361 --> 00:38:22,297\nand the floating point numbers have value.\n\n625\n00:38:22,430 --> 00:38:24,966\nThe reason why they have value\nis because it's intelligence.\n\n626\n00:38:25,099 --> 00:38:26,668\nIt's artificial intelligence.\n\n627\n00:38:26,768 --> 00:38:28,403\nYou can take these \nfloating point numbers.\n\n628\n00:38:28,536 --> 00:38:33,741\nYou reformulate it in such a way that it\nturns into English, French, proteins,\n\n629\n00:38:33,842 --> 00:38:39,981\nchemicals, graphics, images, videos,\nrobotic articulation,\n\n630\n00:38:40,081 --> 00:38:41,583\nsteering wheel articulation.\n\n631\n00:38:41,683 --> 00:38:45,153\nWe're producing tokens\nat extraordinary scale.\n\n632\n00:38:45,253 --> 00:38:48,289\nNow we've discovered a way\nthrough all of the work that we do\n\n633\n00:38:48,389 --> 00:38:52,060\nwith artificial intelligence,\nto produce tokens of almost any kind.\n\n634\n00:38:52,694 --> 00:38:58,933\nSo now, the world is going to\nproduce an enormous amount of tokens.\n\n635\n00:38:59,033 --> 00:39:02,470\nNow these tokens are going to be produced\nin new types of data centers.\n\n636\n00:39:02,570 --> 00:39:05,006\nWe call them AI factories.\n\n637\n00:39:05,106 --> 00:39:10,178\nBack in the last industrial revolution,\nwater comes into a machine,\n\n638\n00:39:10,278 --> 00:39:12,814\nyou light the water on fire, right?\n\n639\n00:39:12,947 --> 00:39:17,252\nTurn it into steam and\nthen it turns into electrons.\n\n640\n00:39:17,552 --> 00:39:19,554\nAtoms come in, electrons go out.\n\n641\n00:39:19,654 --> 00:39:21,389\nIn this new industrial revolution,\n\n642\n00:39:21,489 --> 00:39:24,959\nelectrons come in and\nfloating point numbers come out.\n\n643\n00:39:25,393 --> 00:39:27,896\nAnd just like the last\nindustrial revolution,\n\n644\n00:39:28,029 --> 00:39:32,267\nnobody understood why electricity\nis so valuable and is now sold,\n\n645\n00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:35,536\nmarketed kilowatt hours  per dollar.\n\n646\n00:39:35,870 --> 00:39:39,674\nAnd so now we have\na million tokens per dollar.\n\n647\n00:39:39,941 --> 00:39:42,844\nAnd so that same logic\n\n648\n00:39:42,944 --> 00:39:47,215\nis as incomprehensible to a lot of people\nas the last industrial revolution,\n\n649\n00:39:47,315 --> 00:39:51,853\nbut it's going to be completely normal\nin the next ten years.\n\n650\n00:39:52,353 --> 00:39:58,826\nThese tokens are going to create\nnew products, new services,\n\n651\n00:39:58,927 --> 00:40:02,330\nenhance productivity\non a whole slew of industries.\n\n652\n00:40:02,430 --> 00:40:05,533\n$100 trillion worth of industries\non top of us.\n\n653\n00:40:05,633 --> 00:40:07,669\nAnd so this industry is\ngoing to be gigantic.\n\n654\n00:40:07,769 --> 00:40:14,742\nAnd in order to monetize that, transact \nthat, you're going to need Stripe.\n\n655\n00:40:20,048 --> 00:40:23,051\nI have to tell you,\nthis is one of my favorite companies.\n\n656\n00:40:23,151 --> 00:40:26,220\nThe first time I met Patrick,\nhe had to explain Stripe to me.\n\n657\n00:40:26,321 --> 00:40:29,190\nFirst of all, \nit was so complicated.\n\n658\n00:40:31,059 --> 00:40:33,895\n-We tried to refine\nthe descriptions over time.\n\n659\n00:40:33,995 --> 00:40:37,165\n-First of all, you're in a complicated\nbusiness no matter what.\n\n660\n00:40:37,265 --> 00:40:41,235\nBut nonetheless, \nI was so inspired by it.\n\n661\n00:40:41,336 --> 00:40:42,637\nIncredible what you guys have built.\n\n662\n00:40:42,737 --> 00:40:44,372\n-We're going to get you\nmigrated to Stripe Billing\n\n663\n00:40:44,472 --> 00:40:46,174\nnow that we have\na usage-based billing?\n\n664\n00:40:46,307 --> 00:40:49,711\n-I wish I had a business\nthat required billing.\n\n665\n00:40:50,712 --> 00:40:54,415\n-I think your public filing suggests\nyou're doing a lot of billing.\n\n666\n00:40:56,918 --> 00:40:59,687\nWe'll follow up on it. All right.\n\n667\n00:41:00,521 --> 00:41:03,458\n-It's only ten transactions.\nJust so you know.\n\n668\n00:41:04,592 --> 00:41:09,731\nYour economics serving us is like nothing,\nit's like ten transactions.\n\n669\n00:41:10,198 --> 00:41:11,632\n-We'd happily take the 2.9% .\n\n670\n00:41:11,733 --> 00:41:15,670\nBut anyway,\nwe can discuss that separately.\n\n671\n00:41:18,906 --> 00:41:20,375\n-Done!\n\n672\n00:41:20,475 --> 00:41:24,412\n-You can't say that.\nYou're a public company.\n\n673\n00:41:24,512 --> 00:41:27,315\nThinking about these token factories.\n\n674\n00:41:27,448 --> 00:41:31,753\nI feel like a big question right now\nis whether the models saturate\n\n675\n00:41:31,886 --> 00:41:34,989\nin the sense that, we demoed the\nSigma assistant on stage earlier\n\n676\n00:41:35,123 --> 00:41:37,859\nand you can write some natural language,\nand we convert that to SQL.\n\n677\n00:41:37,959 --> 00:41:41,763\nAnd going from maybe\na 7 billion parameter model\n\n678\n00:41:41,896 --> 00:41:44,432\nto a 70 billion parameter model\nor something like that,\n\n679\n00:41:44,565 --> 00:41:46,401\nthere might be a significant kind of,\n\n680\n00:41:46,501 --> 00:41:49,971\nconsequential improvement in query\naccuracy for the user\n\n681\n00:41:50,071 --> 00:41:52,373\nfor the typical kinds of queries that\npeople tend to construct.\n\n682\n00:41:52,473 --> 00:41:56,144\nBut maybe going to a model that's ten x\nlarger than that is sort of unnecessary.\n\n683\n00:41:56,277 --> 00:41:57,345\nLike at some point you get to good enough,\n\n684\n00:41:57,478 --> 00:41:59,714\nyou can reliably convert the\nnatural language to SQL.\n\n685\n00:41:59,881 --> 00:42:01,682\nI think there's a question of,\n\n686\n00:42:01,783 --> 00:42:05,386\nfor the use cases for which LLM's\nare being deployed,\n\n687\n00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:07,889\nwhat does that\nsaturation curve look like,\n\n688\n00:42:07,989 --> 00:42:11,559\nand for how many use cases does one\nneed a trillion parameter model or\n\n689\n00:42:11,692 --> 00:42:12,760\na 10 trillion parameter model?\n\n690\n00:42:12,894 --> 00:42:16,030\nOr do we simply reach a point where,\nsome number that is, say,\n\n691\n00:42:16,164 --> 00:42:19,467\nless than 100 billion,\nis sufficient?\n\n692\n00:42:19,567 --> 00:42:23,304\nDo you have any point of view on that,\nor is that even\n\n693\n00:42:23,404 --> 00:42:26,541\na reasonable way to look at the\nquestion in the first place?\n\n694\n00:42:26,641 --> 00:42:28,576\n-Okay, let's break it down.\nLet's reason it out.\n\n695\n00:42:30,044 --> 00:42:31,045\n-In public.\n\n696\n00:42:31,312 --> 00:42:33,081\n-Almost everything,  every question I get,\n\n697\n00:42:33,181 --> 00:42:35,116\nokay, let's break it down,\nlet's reason it out.\n\n698\n00:42:35,216 --> 00:42:37,485\nSo, let's start with an example.\n\n699\n00:42:37,752 --> 00:42:41,856\nIn 2012, AlexNet was a computer vision.\n\n700\n00:42:41,956 --> 00:42:47,762\nImageNet, image recognition 82%,\nor something like that, accuracy.\n\n701\n00:42:47,895 --> 00:42:52,100\nOver the next...\nalmost not quite ten years,\n\n702\n00:42:52,233 --> 00:42:53,801\nI think it was like seven years,\n\n703\n00:42:54,102 --> 00:42:59,841\nevery single year, the accuracy\nerror reduced in half.\n\n704\n00:42:59,974 --> 00:43:04,445\nEvery year the error reduced in half\nor otherwise known as Moore's law.\n\n705\n00:43:04,545 --> 00:43:10,084\nSo you double the performance,\nyou double the accuracy,\n\n706\n00:43:10,518 --> 00:43:14,322\nand you double its believability\nevery single year.\n\n707\n00:43:14,422 --> 00:43:16,891\nOver the course of seven years,\nit's now superhuman.\n\n708\n00:43:17,525 --> 00:43:19,260\nSame thing with speech recognition,\n\n709\n00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:22,797\nsame thing with\nnatural language understanding.\n\n710\n00:43:22,897 --> 00:43:27,301\nWe want to know,\nwe want to believe, not know,\n\n711\n00:43:27,401 --> 00:43:31,806\nwe want to believe that the answer that's\nbeing predicted to us is accurate.\n\n712\n00:43:31,906 --> 00:43:33,174\nWe want to believe that.\n\n713\n00:43:33,274 --> 00:43:36,644\nAnd so the industry is going to chase\n\n714\n00:43:36,744 --> 00:43:39,514\nthat believability or that accuracy,\n\n715\n00:43:39,614 --> 00:43:46,454\nand double its accuracy 2x every year.\n\n716\n00:43:46,554 --> 00:43:50,258\nI believe that's going to be the same \nthing with natural language understanding.\n\n717\n00:43:50,391 --> 00:43:54,829\nAnd of course the problem\nspace is a lot more complicated,\n\n718\n00:43:54,962 --> 00:43:56,864\nbut I have every certainty\n\n719\n00:43:56,964 --> 00:44:00,067\nthat we're going to double\nits accuracy every single year\n\n720\n00:44:00,168 --> 00:44:02,470\nto the point where it is so accurate.\n\n721\n00:44:02,603 --> 00:44:05,373\nAnd we've we've largely tested\nacross many of your examples,\n\n722\n00:44:05,473 --> 00:44:07,441\nwhen you interact with it that you go,\n\"You know what?\n\n723\n00:44:07,575 --> 00:44:08,876\nThis is really, really good.\"\n\n724\n00:44:08,976 --> 00:44:13,214\nI believe the answer that it's producing\nfor me, that condition is very important.\n\n725\n00:44:13,347 --> 00:44:15,216\nThe second thing is this.\n\n726\n00:44:18,319 --> 00:44:20,454\nToday's language models, today's AI\n\n727\n00:44:20,555 --> 00:44:22,823\nand everything that\nwe've shown are one shot.\n\n728\n00:44:23,691 --> 00:44:27,461\nAnd yet you and I both know that there are\nmany things that we think about that\n\n729\n00:44:27,562 --> 00:44:29,931\nare not one shot. You have to iterate.\n\n730\n00:44:30,031 --> 00:44:33,201\nAnd so how do you come up--\nHow do you reason about a plan?\n\n731\n00:44:33,334 --> 00:44:37,805\nHow do you come up with a strategy\nto solve a problem?\n\n732\n00:44:37,905 --> 00:44:41,442\nMaybe you need to use tools. Maybe you\nhave to look up some proprietary data.\n\n733\n00:44:41,576 --> 00:44:44,545\nMaybe you have to do\nsome research, in fact.\n\n734\n00:44:44,645 --> 00:44:48,115\nMaybe you have to ask another agent.\nMaybe you have another ask another AI.\n\n735\n00:44:48,216 --> 00:44:51,018\nMaybe you have to be human in a loop.\nAsk a human.\n\n736\n00:44:51,118 --> 00:44:53,721\nTriggering events, send an\nemail to somebody or text to somebody.\n\n737\n00:44:53,854 --> 00:44:58,092\nGet a response before you can move on to\nthe next step of that of that plan.\n\n738\n00:44:58,192 --> 00:45:02,163\nAnd so a large language model has\nto iterate and think of a plan.\n\n739\n00:45:02,930 --> 00:45:04,732\nThat's not a one shot thing.\n\n740\n00:45:04,865 --> 00:45:08,736\nAnd once it comes up with a plan\nas it traverses that graph,\n\n741\n00:45:09,170 --> 00:45:10,571\nthere's a whole bunch\nof language models\n\n742\n00:45:10,671 --> 00:45:13,374\nthat are going to get\ninstantiated and initiated.\n\n743\n00:45:13,474 --> 00:45:17,912\nAnd so I think your\nfuture models are going to iterate.\n\n744\n00:45:18,045 --> 00:45:23,284\nAnd so instead of a one shot model,\n\n745\n00:45:23,417 --> 00:45:24,986\nit's going to be a planning model\n\n746\n00:45:25,086 --> 00:45:26,754\nwith a whole bunch of\nother models around it\n\n747\n00:45:26,854 --> 00:45:28,990\nthat are particularly good at\nparticular skills.\n\n748\n00:45:29,090 --> 00:45:30,758\nAnd so I think\nwe have a long ways to go.\n\n749\n00:45:32,360 --> 00:45:35,863\n-Meta garnered a lot of attention last\nweek for the release of Llama 3,\n\n750\n00:45:35,963 --> 00:45:38,933\nwhich seems to be the most impressive\nopen-source model thus far.\n\n751\n00:45:39,033 --> 00:45:40,901\nAny thoughts on open-source models?\n\n752\n00:45:42,169 --> 00:45:46,073\n-If you ask me, what are the top\n\n753\n00:45:46,173 --> 00:45:48,643\nmost important events in\nthe last couple of years?\n\n754\n00:45:48,743 --> 00:45:51,112\nI would tell you, of course, ChatGPT,\n\n755\n00:45:51,212 --> 00:45:52,747\nreinforcement learning, human feedback,\n\n756\n00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:56,951\ngrounding it to human values and having\nthe technology necessary to do that.\n\n757\n00:45:57,051 --> 00:46:02,990\nObviously a breakthrough,\nand democratized computing.\n\n758\n00:46:03,524 --> 00:46:05,760\nIt made it possible for everybody\nto be a programmer.\n\n759\n00:46:05,893 --> 00:46:08,396\nEverybody is now doing amazing\nthings with it.\n\n760\n00:46:08,496 --> 00:46:12,033\nChatGPT, the work that OpenAI did,\n\n761\n00:46:12,166 --> 00:46:14,335\nGreg and Sam and the team,\nreally proud of them.\n\n762\n00:46:15,002 --> 00:46:21,008\nThe second thing that I would say\nthat is just as important,\n\n763\n00:46:21,142 --> 00:46:25,813\nI would say, is Llama,\nnot Llama 1, but Llama 2.\n\n764\n00:46:25,913 --> 00:46:30,685\nLlama 2 activated just\nabout every industry\n\n765\n00:46:30,785 --> 00:46:34,522\nto jump into working on generative AI.\n\n766\n00:46:35,122 --> 00:46:39,093\nAnd it opened the floodgates\nof every industry\n\n767\n00:46:39,193 --> 00:46:41,262\nbeing able to access this technology,\n\n768\n00:46:41,362 --> 00:46:44,231\nhealth care, financial services, \nyou name it,\n\n769\n00:46:44,332 --> 00:46:48,669\nmanufacturing, you name it,\ncustomer service, retail, all kinds.\n\n770\n00:46:48,803 --> 00:46:51,339\nI think Llama 2 and Llama 3,\n\n771\n00:46:52,006 --> 00:46:55,042\nbecause it's open-sourced,\nit engaged research,\n\n772\n00:46:55,142 --> 00:46:59,780\nit engaged startups, engaged industry.\nIt made generative AI accessible.\n\n773\n00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:02,149\nI think that's a very big deal.\n\n774\n00:47:02,249 --> 00:47:05,820\nAnd so I think ChatGPT\ndemocratized computing.\n\n775\n00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:09,490\nI think Llama democratized generative AI.\nDoes that make sense?\n\n776\n00:47:09,590 --> 00:47:11,525\nAnd I think without it,\n\n777\n00:47:11,659 --> 00:47:16,297\nit's very hard to have activated all of\nthe research on safety\n\n778\n00:47:16,397 --> 00:47:18,833\nand all of the different ways\nof chains of thoughts.\n\n779\n00:47:18,933 --> 00:47:22,136\nAnd all the reasoning technology\nthat's now being developed\n\n780\n00:47:22,269 --> 00:47:24,505\nand all the reinforcement learning stuff.\n\n781\n00:47:24,638 --> 00:47:27,742\nAnd that stuff would have been very hard\n\n782\n00:47:27,842 --> 00:47:29,710\nto have activated without Llama.\n\n783\n00:47:29,810 --> 00:47:34,582\n-Dario Amodei was on Ezra Klein's\npodcast two weeks ago.\n\n784\n00:47:34,715 --> 00:47:37,451\nAnd he, as many others have,\n\n785\n00:47:37,551 --> 00:47:42,456\nmany others in particular who are\ninvolved with Frontier Labs,\n\n786\n00:47:42,556 --> 00:47:46,727\nwas predicting AGI in\nthe relatively near term.\n\n787\n00:47:46,827 --> 00:47:48,729\nConceivably the next couple of years,\n\n788\n00:47:48,863 --> 00:47:52,433\nyears like 2027, and so on,\nare frequently thrown around.\n\n789\n00:47:52,533 --> 00:47:54,268\nThoughts?\n\n790\n00:47:54,735 --> 00:47:57,638\n-Depending on how you define AGI.\n\n791\n00:47:57,905 --> 00:48:00,574\nNow, first of all, as an engineer,\n\n792\n00:48:00,674 --> 00:48:04,945\nyou know that we can\nonly solve a problem,\n\n793\n00:48:05,045 --> 00:48:07,381\nultimately, if you can measure it.\n\n794\n00:48:08,082 --> 00:48:11,018\nAnd so you have to express\nthe problem statement,\n\n795\n00:48:11,118 --> 00:48:15,022\nthe mission, somehow,\nin some some measurable way.\n\n796\n00:48:15,156 --> 00:48:20,161\nIf you told me that AGI is the\nlist of benchmarks we currently use,\n\n797\n00:48:20,261 --> 00:48:23,831\nthere are math tests,\nand English comprehension tests,\n\n798\n00:48:23,931 --> 00:48:30,404\nand reasoning tests,\nand you got medical exams, and bars,\n\n799\n00:48:30,504 --> 00:48:33,240\nand you make your list of all\nof the tests that you want.\n\n800\n00:48:33,340 --> 00:48:36,177\nIt doesn't matter what it is,\njust make your list.\n\n801\n00:48:36,277 --> 00:48:39,480\nIf you make your list, I am certain\n\n802\n00:48:39,580 --> 00:48:43,884\nwe will achieve excellent results\nin a very nominal amount of time.\n\n803\n00:48:44,018 --> 00:48:48,055\nAnd if that's the definition of AGI,\nI'll make a guess,\n\n804\n00:48:48,189 --> 00:48:51,125\nit's probably definitely within\nthe next five years.\n\n805\n00:48:51,225 --> 00:48:56,130\nAnd so all of the tests that we currently\nmeasure these models with,\n\n806\n00:48:56,430 --> 00:48:58,933\nthey're improving their accuracy\n\n807\n00:48:59,033 --> 00:49:03,270\nor their error rate is reducing\nin half every six months.\n\n808\n00:49:03,704 --> 00:49:06,774\nAnd so there's no reason why\nwe shouldn't expect it\n\n809\n00:49:06,874 --> 00:49:08,542\nall to be superhuman pretty soon.\n\n810\n00:49:08,642 --> 00:49:10,444\n-So again, everyone in this audience--\n-That doesn't--\n\n811\n00:49:10,544 --> 00:49:13,514\nThat doesn't meet the standard.\nJust be clear.\n\n812\n00:49:13,647 --> 00:49:17,384\nThat doesn't meet the standard\nof a normal person thinking it's AGI.\n\n813\n00:49:17,518 --> 00:49:23,123\nDoes that make sense?\nAn on-the-street-person, \"Hey AGI.\"\n\n814\n00:49:23,257 --> 00:49:26,961\nThat's probably not what they're thinking,\nwhat I defined it as.\n\n815\n00:49:27,328 --> 00:49:30,431\nThe way I defined it is simply\nan engineering way of defining it\n\n816\n00:49:30,531 --> 00:49:32,066\nso that you can answer that question.\n\n817\n00:49:32,199 --> 00:49:35,636\nThe second way of answering the question\nis when can you achieve AGI\n\n818\n00:49:35,736 --> 00:49:38,172\nin an undefined way?\n\n819\n00:49:38,272 --> 00:49:41,141\nIf it's undefinable,\nthen how long would you know?\n\n820\n00:49:41,275 --> 00:49:43,110\nHow long would it take? Undefinable.\n\n821\n00:49:43,711 --> 00:49:46,247\n-And so everyone in this audience\nagain runs a business.\n\n822\n00:49:46,380 --> 00:49:51,886\nAnd a practical question they/we \nall face is\n\n823\n00:49:52,052 --> 00:49:57,958\nhow do you know if you're, in the face of\nthe kinds of changes you just depicted,\n\n824\n00:49:58,058 --> 00:50:00,561\nhow does one know, how can one know\n\n825\n00:50:00,661 --> 00:50:06,267\nwhether one is responding appropriately,\nsufficiently, in the right ways, etc.?\n\n826\n00:50:07,001 --> 00:50:08,068\nAny advice?\n\n827\n00:50:08,168 --> 00:50:15,442\n-If you're not engaging AI actively\nand aggressively, you're doing it wrong.\n\n828\n00:50:15,543 --> 00:50:17,678\nYou're not going to lose your job to AI.\n\n829\n00:50:17,778 --> 00:50:20,447\nYou're going to lose your job\nto somebody who uses AI.\n\n830\n00:50:20,881 --> 00:50:23,784\nYour company is not going to go\nout of business because of AI.\n\n831\n00:50:23,884 --> 00:50:27,922\nYour company is going to go out of\nbusiness because another company used AI.\n\n832\n00:50:28,322 --> 00:50:29,990\nThere's no question about that.\n\n833\n00:50:30,090 --> 00:50:32,593\nAnd so you have to engage\nAI as quickly as possible.\n\n834\n00:50:32,726 --> 00:50:34,361\nYou have to engage AI\nas quickly as possible,\n\n835\n00:50:34,495 --> 00:50:39,066\nso that you could do things that\nyou think cost too much to do.\n\n836\n00:50:39,199 --> 00:50:45,172\nFor example, if the marginal cost of\nintelligence was practically zero.\n\n837\n00:50:45,272 --> 00:50:48,108\nThere are a lot of things that\nyou would do now\n\n838\n00:50:48,208 --> 00:50:49,677\nthat you wouldn't have done otherwise.\n\n839\n00:50:49,777 --> 00:50:52,880\nAnd so notice how often we do search\n\n840\n00:50:53,013 --> 00:50:56,817\nand these days notice how\noften we ask questions.\n\n841\n00:50:56,917 --> 00:51:00,521\nAny random question,\nI'll be asking Perplexity.\n\n842\n00:51:00,955 --> 00:51:02,756\nRight. And so why not.\n\n843\n00:51:02,856 --> 00:51:05,125\n-Or, just gave a talk here at Sessions.\n\n844\n00:51:05,225 --> 00:51:07,861\n-Okay, I love using it.\n\n845\n00:51:07,962 --> 00:51:12,099\nAnd even if I know the answer,\nI'll just ask it anyways,\n\n846\n00:51:12,199 --> 00:51:13,867\njust to see what it comes up with.\n\n847\n00:51:14,001 --> 00:51:18,372\nAnd so, I think we want that to happen.\n\n848\n00:51:18,472 --> 00:51:19,807\nWe want the marginal cost\n\n849\n00:51:19,940 --> 00:51:22,076\nof these type of activities\nto be as low as possible\n\n850\n00:51:22,176 --> 00:51:24,078\nso that you use it in abundance.\n\n851\n00:51:24,211 --> 00:51:28,582\nSecond, if you could use AI\nto be productive--\n\n852\n00:51:29,817 --> 00:51:34,221\nYou know that productive companies\nleads to higher earnings.\n\n853\n00:51:34,355 --> 00:51:36,590\nHigher earnings leads to more employment.\n\n854\n00:51:37,725 --> 00:51:39,860\nMore employment leads to\nmore social growth.\n\n855\n00:51:39,994 --> 00:51:44,565\nAnd so, there's a lot of reasons to want \nto drive productivity into companies.\n\n856\n00:51:44,665 --> 00:51:49,603\n-And apart from just changing your\nmanufacturing plans and your CapEx plans,\n\n857\n00:51:49,703 --> 00:51:53,374\nhow has AI changed how NVIDIA\nworks internally?\n\n858\n00:51:53,907 --> 00:51:56,510\n-We were one of the first technology\ncompanies to invest\n\n859\n00:51:56,610 --> 00:51:59,213\nin our own AI supercomputers.\n\n860\n00:51:59,313 --> 00:52:03,484\nWe can't design a chip\nanymore without AI.\n\n861\n00:52:03,584 --> 00:52:08,222\nAt night, our AIs are\nexploring design spaces,\n\n862\n00:52:08,322 --> 00:52:10,691\nvast and wide that we would\nnever do ourselves\n\n863\n00:52:10,791 --> 00:52:12,459\nbecause it costs too much\nmoney to explore it.\n\n864\n00:52:12,559 --> 00:52:18,666\nAnd so our chips are so much better.\n\n865\n00:52:18,766 --> 00:52:22,036\nBecause of an AI, we could reduce the\namount of energy used for our chips\n\n866\n00:52:22,136 --> 00:52:24,371\nas higher performance.\n\n867\n00:52:24,772 --> 00:52:28,475\nOur software.

But...\n\n888\n00:53:48,255 --> 00:53:50,257\nIs there a large language\nmodel for Irish?\n\n889\n00:53:50,591 --> 00:53:53,193\n-I've tried it.\n-It works?\n\n890\n00:53:53,293 --> 00:53:55,662\n-Yeah, it works well.\n\n891\n00:53:55,763 --> 00:54:01,769\nJohn and I spent most of our education\nin Ireland, being taught in Irish.\n\n892\n00:54:02,069 --> 00:54:06,340\nAnd so, these models are\nsome of the first people\n\n893\n00:54:06,440 --> 00:54:12,179\nI've had the chance to have\na dialog with as Gaeilge [in Irish].\n\n894\n00:54:12,312 --> 00:54:13,347\n-Very surprising.\n\n895\n00:54:13,447 --> 00:54:14,782\n-In many years. Yeah.\n\n896\n00:54:14,882 --> 00:54:17,584\nThey do well, and actually I've been--\nHave you played with Suno?\n\n897\n00:54:17,684 --> 00:54:24,358\n-Suno?\n-Suno is an app for creating music,\n\n898\n00:54:24,558 --> 00:54:26,193\nkind of synthetic music.\n-Okay.\n\n899\n00:54:26,293 --> 00:54:29,429\n-And I've been enjoying creating...\n-Irish music.\n\n900\n00:54:29,563 --> 00:54:31,165\n-I of course tested it on that.\n\n901\n00:54:31,265 --> 00:54:34,201\nAnd Celtic dubstep is\na thing that it can do.\n\n902\n00:54:35,335 --> 00:54:37,237\n-Fantastic. Okay. Makes sense.\n\n903\n00:54:37,371 --> 00:54:39,239\nLike if it could do that,\n\n904\n00:54:39,473 --> 00:54:42,442\nthen of course it could learn\nthe language of life.\n\n905\n00:54:43,477 --> 00:54:45,012\nOf course they can learn the--\n\n906\n00:54:45,112 --> 00:54:48,415\nAnd if a language model\ncan understand sound\n\n907\n00:54:48,515 --> 00:54:52,586\nwhich is a sequence time series,\nit's a sequence.\n\n908\n00:54:52,686 --> 00:54:57,057\nWhy can't it learn robotics articulation\nwhich is a sequence.\n\n909\n00:54:57,191 --> 00:55:00,260\nYou just have to figure out\nhow to tokenize it.\n\n910\n00:55:00,360 --> 00:55:04,097\nAnd so the idea that all of\na sudden, \"Oh hey, look, listen,\n\n911\n00:55:04,198 --> 00:55:08,001\nI could also learn SQL,\nI could learn ABAP, I can learn Lightning,\n\n912\n00:55:08,101 --> 00:55:10,671\nI can learn all these proprietary\nlanguages, I can learn Verilog,\n\n913\n00:55:10,804 --> 00:55:14,842\nI can learn, right.

A ver. Hay un malentendido.\r\n\r\n89\r\n00:06:01,224 --> 00:06:02,559\r\nHay una frase que dice:\r\n\r\n90\r\n00:06:02,659 --> 00:06:08,632\r\n\"Debes elegir tu carrera en función de tu pasión\".\r\n\r\n91\r\n00:06:08,732 --> 00:06:13,536\r\nGeneralmente la gente relaciona la pasión con la felicidad.\r\n\r\n92\r\n00:06:14,604 --> 00:06:17,641\r\nY creo que ahí falta algo.\r\n\r\n93\r\n00:06:17,741 --> 00:06:20,911\r\nNo pasa nada, pero falta algo.\r\n\r\n94\r\n00:06:21,044 --> 00:06:23,847\r\nY la razón de esto es porque si quieres hacer grandes cosas,\r\n\r\n95\r\n00:06:23,947 --> 00:06:27,684\r\nY sé que esto es cierto acerca de tu creación de Stripe.\r\n\r\n96\r\n00:06:27,784 --> 00:06:32,522\r\nY, por cierto, este es uno de los mejores directores ejecutivos del mundo.\r\n\r\n97\r\n00:06:32,622 --> 00:06:34,457\r\nPor joven que sea, sí.\r\n\r\n98\r\n00:06:37,894 --> 00:06:41,665\r\nYa saben, he conocido a muchos directores ejecutivos y he oído hablar de muchas empresas.\r\n\r\n99\r\n00:06:41,798 --> 00:06:45,402\r\nY ésta es realmente una de las grandes empresas visionarias del mundo.\r\n\r\n100\r\n00:06:45,502 --> 00:06:48,038\r\nY de todos modos, sólo quiero decir eso.\r\n\r\n101\r\n00:06:48,204 --> 00:06:50,707\r\nEs la razón por la que me encanta lo que...\r\n\r\n102\r\n00:06:50,807 --> 00:06:53,209\r\n-Ya no se permiten más cumplidos, nos hacen sentir terriblemente incómodos.\r\n\r\n103\r\n00:06:53,343 --> 00:06:56,546\r\n-Lo sé, lo noté. Lo vi, estaba empezando a sudar.\r\n\r\n104\r\n00:06:57,981 --> 00:07:03,253\r\nY así es como funciona, cuando quieres construir algo grandioso,\r\n\r\n105\r\n00:07:03,353 --> 00:07:05,722\r\nNo es fácil hacerlo.\r\n\r\n106\r\n00:07:05,822 --> 00:07:07,590\r\nY cuando estás haciendo algo que no es fácil de hacer,\r\n\r\n107\r\n00:07:07,724 --> 00:07:10,460\r\nNo siempre lo disfrutas.\r\n\r\n108\r\n00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:13,229\r\nNo amo todos los días de mi trabajo.\r\n\r\n109\r\n00:07:13,363 --> 00:07:15,432\r\nNo creo que todos los días me traigan alegría,\r\n\r\n110\r\n00:07:15,532 --> 00:07:19,269\r\nLa alegría tampoco tiene por qué ser la definición de un buen día.\r\n\r\n111\r\n00:07:19,369 --> 00:07:21,237\r\nY cada día no soy feliz.\r\n\r\n112\r\n00:07:21,338 --> 00:07:23,573\r\nCada año no estoy contento con la empresa.\r\n\r\n113\r\n00:07:23,773 --> 00:07:26,876\r\nPero amo la compañía cada segundo.\r\n\r\n114\r\n00:07:27,677 --> 00:07:31,247\r\nY por eso creo que lo que la gente malinterpreta es...\r\n\r\n115\r\n00:07:31,381 --> 00:07:35,986\r\nDe alguna manera los mejores trabajos son los que te traen felicidad todo el tiempo.\r\n\r\n116\r\n00:07:36,119 --> 00:07:41,324\r\nNo creo que eso sea correcto. Tienes que sufrir.\r\n\r\n117\r\n00:07:41,458 --> 00:07:44,961\r\nTienes que luchar. Tienes que esforzarte.\r\n\r\n118\r\n00:07:45,095 --> 00:07:46,796\r\nTienes que hacer esas cosas difíciles\r\n\r\n119\r\n00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:51,568\r\ny trabajar en ello para poder apreciar realmente lo que has hecho.\r\n\r\n120\r\n00:07:52,102 --> 00:07:56,006\r\nY no hay cosas grandiosas que sean fáciles de hacer.\r\n\r\n121\r\n00:07:56,473 --> 00:08:01,211\r\nY entonces, por definición, yo diría por tanto,\r\n\r\n122\r\n00:08:01,311 --> 00:08:05,749\r\nOs deseo grandeza, que, a mi modo de decirlo,\r\n\r\n123\r\n00:08:05,882 --> 00:08:09,419\r\nTe deseo mucho dolor y sufrimiento.\r\n\r\n124\r\n00:08:16,192 --> 00:08:19,629\r\n-¿Hay algo en tu crianza que te haya enseñado esa idea?\r\n\r\n125\r\n00:08:19,763 --> 00:08:22,465\r\n¿O es simplemente algo innato en tu maquillaje?\r\n\r\n126\r\n00:08:29,305 --> 00:08:31,441\r\n-No me di cuenta que tenía que acostarme para esto.\r\n\r\n127\r\n00:08:36,146 --> 00:08:39,315\r\nVoy a contarte cosas que nunca le he contado a nadie. Ni siquiera a mi familia.\r\n\r\n128\r\n00:08:43,053 --> 00:08:48,324\r\nYo era inmigrante. Y cuando llegué en 1973, tenía nueve años.\r\n\r\n129\r\n00:08:48,425 --> 00:08:50,760\r\nMi hermano mayor tenía casi 11 años.\r\n\r\n130\r\n00:08:50,894 --> 00:08:57,600\r\nY éste era un país extranjero y no había nada fácil en ello.\r\n\r\n131\r\n00:08:57,734 --> 00:09:04,674\r\nY también crecimos con unos padres realmente fabulosos.\r\n\r\n132\r\n00:09:04,774 --> 00:09:09,179\r\nPero no éramos ricos. Así que trabajaron duro, y siguen trabajando duro hoy.\r\n\r\n133\r\n00:09:09,512 --> 00:09:13,917\r\nY así transmitieron muchas lecciones de vida trabajando duro.\r\n\r\n134\r\n00:09:14,184 --> 00:09:16,820\r\nTuve todo tipo de trabajos.\r\n\r\n135\r\n00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:23,359\r\ny fuimos a una escuela que incluía muchas tareas.\r\n\r\n136\r\n00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:24,461\r\n-¿Está en Kentucky?\r\n\r\n137\r\n00:09:24,561 --> 00:09:28,098\r\n-Sí, Kentucky. Instituto Bautista Oneida.\r\n\r\n138\r\n00:09:28,198 --> 00:09:33,970\r\nNo creo que sea lo mismo que 'MIT', que 'yo' no sea lo mismo.\r\n\r\n139\r\n00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:39,075\r\nEs la misma palabra, pero es diferente. Es un tipo diferente de instituto.\r\n\r\n140\r\n00:09:39,476 --> 00:09:44,047\r\nPero mi instituto requería que fueras a la escuela, y era un dormitorio,\r\n\r\n141\r\n00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:45,548\r\nY entonces hubo muchas tareas.\r\n\r\n142\r\n00:09:45,782 --> 00:09:47,383\r\nYo era el niño más pequeño de la escuela,\r\n\r\n143\r\n00:09:47,517 --> 00:09:49,886\r\nY así todos los demás niños tuvieron que trabajar duro.\r\n\r\n144\r\n00:09:49,986 --> 00:09:53,690\r\nEllos tenían que trabajar en la plantación de tabaco y a mí me tocó el trabajo fácil.\r\n\r\n145\r\n00:09:53,823 --> 00:09:57,660\r\nYo tenía nueve años y después de que se fueron, tuve que limpiar todos los baños.\r\n\r\n146\r\n00:09:58,628 --> 00:10:02,332\r\nNunca sentí que conseguí el trabajo fácil,\r\n\r\n147\r\n00:10:02,465 --> 00:10:07,070\r\nPorque lo que dejaron atrás fue... No puedes dejar de ver ese tipo de cosas.\r\n\r\n148\r\n00:10:09,072 --> 00:10:12,008\r\nPero ese era mi trabajo y lo hice con mucho gusto.\r\n\r\n149\r\n00:10:12,108 --> 00:10:17,046\r\nY luego tuve muchos otros trabajos, y Denny's fue uno de ellos.\r\n\r\n150\r\n00:10:17,147 --> 00:10:21,050\r\nY empecé como lavaplatos, luego me convertí en ayudante de camarero y luego en camarero.\r\n\r\n151\r\n00:10:21,151 --> 00:10:23,887\r\nY los amé a todos.

flotante.\r\n\r\n643\r\n00:39:25,393 --> 00:39:27,896\r\nY al igual que la última revolución industrial,\r\n\r\n644\r\n00:39:28,029 --> 00:39:32,267\r\nNadie entendió por qué la electricidad es tan valiosa y ahora se vende,\r\n\r\n645\r\n00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:35,536\r\nkilovatios hora comercializados por dólar.\r\n\r\n646\r\n00:39:35,870 --> 00:39:39,674\r\nY ahora tenemos un millón de tokens por dólar.\r\n\r\n647\r\n00:39:39,941 --> 00:39:42,844\r\nY entonces esa misma lógica\r\n\r\n648\r\n00:39:42,944 --> 00:39:47,215\r\nEs tan incomprensible para mucha gente como la última revolución industrial,\r\n\r\n649\r\n00:39:47,315 --> 00:39:51,853\r\nPero será completamente normal en los próximos diez años.\r\n\r\n650\r\n00:39:52,353 --> 00:39:58,826\r\nEstos tokens van a crear nuevos productos, nuevos servicios,\r\n\r\n651\r\n00:39:58,927 --> 00:40:02,330\r\nmejorar la productividad en una gran variedad de industrias.\r\n\r\n652\r\n00:40:02,430 --> 00:40:05,533\r\nIndustrias por valor de 100 billones de dólares encima de nosotros.\r\n\r\n653\r\n00:40:05,633 --> 00:40:07,669\r\nY esta industria va a ser gigantesca.\r\n\r\n654\r\n00:40:07,769 --> 00:40:14,742\r\nY para monetizar eso, para realizar transacciones, necesitarás Stripe.\r\n\r\n655\r\n00:40:20,048 --> 00:40:23,051\r\nTengo que decirles que esta es una de mis empresas favoritas.\r\n\r\n656\r\n00:40:23,151

complicado.\r\n\r\n658\r\n00:40:31,059 --> 00:40:33,895\r\n-Intentamos refinar las descripciones con el tiempo.\r\n\r\n659\r\n00:40:33,995 --> 00:40:37,165\r\n-En primer lugar, estás en un negocio complicado, pase lo que pase.\r\n\r\n660\r\n00:40:37,265 --> 00:40:41,235\r\nPero aún así, me inspiró mucho.\r\n\r\n661\r\n00:40:41,336 --> 00:40:42,637\r\nIncreíble lo que han construido.\r\n\r\n662\r\n00:40:42,737 --> 00:40:44,372\r\n-Lo vamos a migrar a Stripe Billing\r\n\r\n663\r\n00:40:44,472 --> 00:40:46,174\r\n¿Ahora que tenemos una facturación basada en uso?\r\n\r\n664\r\n00:40:46,307 --> 00:40:49,711\r\n-Desearía tener un negocio que requiriera facturación.\r\n\r\n665\r\n00:40:50,712 --> 00:40:54,415\r\n-Creo que su presentación pública sugiere que

Está bien.\r\n\r\n667\r\n00:41:00,521 --> 00:41:03,458\r\n-Solo son diez transacciones. Para que lo sepas.\r\n\r\n668\r\n00:41:04,592 --> 00:41:09,731\r\nSu economía al servicio de nosotros no es nada, es como diez transacciones.\r\n\r\n669\r\n00:41:10,198 --> 00:41:11,632\r\n-Aceptaríamos con mucho gusto el 2,9%.\r\n\r\n670\r\n00:41:11,733 --> 00:41:15,670\r\nPero de todos modos podemos discutirlo por separado.\r\n\r\n671\r\n00:41:18,906 --> 00:41:20,375\r\n-¡Hecho!\r\n\r\n672\r\n00:41:20,475 --> 00:41:24,412\r\n-No puedes decir eso.

We had the we had the\n\n90\n00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:42,319\nthe inside track in the sense that uh we\n\n91\n00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:44,640\nalways believed that CUDA was going to\n\n92\n00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:47,200\nenable a new class of applications and\n\n93\n00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:50,799\nwe were always looking out for it. And\n\n94\n00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:53,120\nso when when um Alexet came along um\n\n95\n00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:56,640\nbuilt on top of CUDA, our GPUs made it\n\n96\n00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:59,120\npossible uh to train AlexNet and for\n\n97\n00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:01,599\nAlex Net to achieve such extraordinary\n\n98\n00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:04,879\nresults in computer vision, achieve the\n\n99\n00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:07,120\nlevel of capability that um computer\n\n100\n00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:09,120\nscientists specializing in computer\n\n101\n00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:11,760\nvision could not achieve over four\n\n102\n00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:15,200\ndecades. You know, for three people to\n\n103\n00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:17,919\nto do something like that. um uh it's\n\n104\n00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:20,000\njust an extraordinary feat. And so we\n\n105\n00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:21,680\ntook the opportunity and we we looked at\n\n106\n00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,680\nwhat is it that we're looking at? You\n\n107\n00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:26,240\nknow, what what's going on here? Is this\n\n108\n00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:29,360\nis Alec Alex al Alexnet a breakthrough\n\n109\n00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:31,440\nin computer vision or is it a bigger\n\n110\n00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:34,080\nidea than that? And of course, as we\n\n111\n00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:36,080\nknow, computer vision is a pillar of\n\n112\n00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:37,680\nartificial intelligence. You know,\n\n113\n00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:39,280\nwithout computer vision, without speech\n\n114\n00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,840\nlanguage understanding, it's hard to\n\n115\n00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:43,520\nhave intelligence. And and so we we\n\n116\n00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:45,440\nrealized that this of course was a part\n\n117\n00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,880\nof artificial intelligence. But is it a\n\n118\n00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:49,840\nbigger idea than that? And we came to\n\n119\n00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:53,680\nthe conclusion that what AlexNet and\n\n120\n00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:56,880\ndeep learning showed is that it is now\n\n121\n00:04:53,680 --> 00:05:00,000\nfinally possible if we had enough data,\n\n122\n00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:01,600\nenough computing scale. And of course we\n\n123\n00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,520\nhave these deep learning models that are\n\n124\n00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:07,039\nquite scalable\n\n125\n00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:10,000\num that we might be able to apply\n\n126\n00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:12,240\ncomputers to solve problems uh that were\n\n127\n00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,720\nimpossible to describe using human\n\n128\n00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:17,280\nengineered feature and using principled\n\n129\n00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:19,360\nalgorithms. And so we we um we got\n\n130\n00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:21,039\nexcited from that perspective. We also\n\n131\n00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:23,840\ngot excited because\n\n132\n00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:26,400\n>> because when you when you reason through\n\n133\n00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:29,280\num deep learning and and the training of\n\n134\n00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:31,199\nAlexNet and where it could go, we\n\n135\n00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:32,400\nrealized that the entire computing\n\n136\n00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:34,160\nplatform is going to change,\n\n137\n00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:35,680\n>> right? processors are going to change,\n\n138\n00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:37,600\nthe internet connect's going to change,\n\n139\n00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:39,440\nthe networking is going to change, the\n\n140\n00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:41,759\nsoftware stack on top of it, how you\n\n141\n00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:44,080\ndevelop the software, the methodology of\n\n142\n00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:46,080\nsoftware inside companies and of course\n\n143\n00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:48,000\nthe many industries that we might be\n\n144\n00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:50,479\nable to create was going to completely\n\n145\n00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:53,440\nchange and so we went about doing that.\n\n146\n00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:54,800\nWe re reset our company essentially. Now\n\n147\n00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:58,240\nthe the waves that you were talking\n\n148\n00:05:54,800 --> 00:06:00,639\nabout after we did that um we dedicated\n\n149\n00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:02,639\nourselves to uh creating new libraries\n\n150\n00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:05,759\ncalled KDNN\n\n151\n00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:09,520\nuh creating creating uh AI frameworks uh\n\n152\n00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:12,639\ncalled Mega Core um Megatron core uh to\n\n153\n00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:15,680\nuh inventing MVLink and tensor cores and\n\n154\n00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:17,840\nthe different numerical formats and uh\n\n155\n00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:21,199\nwe led to uh the creation of a system we\n\n156\n00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:23,039\ncall DGX1 our first AI supercomput. I\n\n157\n00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:24,400\npersonally delivered it to a startup in\n\n158\n00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:27,919\nSan Francisco which turned out to have\n\n159\n00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:30,560\nbeen open AI and and so anyways that\n\n160\n00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:33,199\njourney uh could really be captured in\n\n161\n00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:36,160\nseveral ways. Since 2012, the first\n\n162\n00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:38,160\nthing that happened, AI took off. Uh,\n\n163\n00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:39,840\ndeep learning kept advancing. The amount\n\n164\n00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:42,479\nof data we had, the amount of compute we\n\n165\n00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:44,240\nhad kept growing, kept scaling. And it\n\n166\n00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:47,680\nled to the first wave, which is really\n\n167\n00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:49,440\ndescribed as, if I could, perception. We\n\n168\n00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:50,479\nwe solved perception. It became\n\n169\n00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:52,240\nsuperhuman.\n\n170\n00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:54,319\n>> Computer vision became superhuman.\n\n171\n00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:56,800\nLanguage understanding or speech\n\n172\n00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:58,960\nrecognition became superhuman. The\n\n173\n00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,560\nsecond the second phase is uh\n\n174\n00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:03,919\ngenerative.\n\n175\n00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:06,560\nuh we can now not only understand\n\n176\n00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:09,199\ninformation but we can translate and\n\n177\n00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:11,120\ngenerate information. So text to text,\n\n178\n00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:13,680\ntext to images,\n\n179\n00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:15,840\n>> images to text, text to video.\n\n180\n00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:18,400\n>> And so if you could do text to video,\n\n181\n00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:20,319\nyou know what else can't can you do? So\n\n182\n00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:22,880\nsecond phase was generative AI. This\n\n183\n00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:25,120\nthird third wave is the wave that we're\n\n184\n00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:28,319\nin today, you know, really deeply\n\n185\n00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:28,880\nsolidly into which is uh reasoning AI.\n\n186\n00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:32,080\nMhm.\n\n187\n00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:36,240\n>> This is where an AI could apply\n\n188\n00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:39,599\nprinciples and knowledge, maybe some\n\n189\n00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:43,919\ncommon sense and use techniques like\n\n190\n00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:47,039\nchain of thought, trees of thought um to\n\n191\n00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:49,759\nuh break down the problem into multiple\n\n192\n00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:52,319\nsteps, reason about how to solve the\n\n193\n00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:54,479\nproblem, the larger goal step by step.\n\n194\n00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:57,360\nIt might even do some research, read\n\n195\n00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:59,199\nsome documents, read an archive paper\n\n196\n00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,879\nbefore it answers the question.\n\n197\n00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:05,759\n>> And so the third wave that we're in\n\n198\n00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:08,479\ntoday, which is reasoning, is a very big\n\n199\n00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:10,560\npart of seeing the acceleration of AI\n\n200\n00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:12,400\nbecoming AI. That's this the fact that\n\n201\n00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:15,039\nwe're we're doing reasoning AI is the\n\n202\n00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:17,520\nreason why why um uh people are starting\n\n203\n00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:18,240\nto say, you know, we're near uh general\n\n204\n00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:20,879\nintelligence,\n\n205\n00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:24,160\n>> right?

Now why is that?\n\n378\n00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:27,760\nIn fact, you could say that when\n\n379\n00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:30,079\nproductivity goes up, employment would\n\n380\n00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:33,199\ngo down because you could do more with\n\n381\n00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:36,000\nfewer people, right? But that's because\n\n382\n00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:37,839\nthat lacks imagination.\n\n383\n00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,160\nIf your company, let's just take it from\n\n384\n00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:43,120\na company's perspective. If a company\n\n385\n00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:46,399\nhas no new ideas and it's literally\n\n386\n00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:48,480\ndoing one thing and one thing only, when\n\n387\n00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:50,720\nour productivity goes up, we need fewer\n\n388\n00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:53,120\npeople to do it. But if you look at\n\n389\n00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:54,800\nNvidia, we have so many ideas. is we\n\n390\n00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:58,880\ndon't have enough time or people to go\n\n391\n00:15:54,800 --> 00:16:01,519\ndo it. The backlog of great ideas that\n\n392\n00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:03,519\nwe would love to go try\n\n393\n00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:05,839\nnew markets and new applications we like\n\n394\n00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:07,360\nto go create the backlog of that is\n\n395\n00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:09,839\nincredible.\n\n396\n00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:12,160\nNow, if I just had more people, more\n\n397\n00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:13,680\ntime, you know, considering how fast how\n\n398\n00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:15,360\nhow hard we're already working, I'm\n\n399\n00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:17,040\nalready working. If I just had more\n\n400\n00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:19,680\npeople, if I had more time, if I were\n\n401\n00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:21,040\nmore productive, we do more. Our company\n\n402\n00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:23,120\nwould be able to offer more things,\n\n403\n00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:25,600\nwould be be able to invent new ideas\n\n404\n00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:27,839\nthat created new industries. And so the\n\n405\n00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:31,519\nthe real the real theme is that are you\n\n406\n00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:34,320\na do you do you are you a hopeful person\n\n407\n00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:37,839\noptimistic person and you believe in in\n\n408\n00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:39,680\nidea creation or are you somebody who\n\n409\n00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:41,199\nbelieves you know there are no new ideas\n\n410\n00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:44,000\nleft\n\n411\n00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:46,320\nand quite frankly we're just working and\n\n412\n00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,959\nif we could just do that work more\n\n413\n00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:50,959\nproductively we'll be out of work right\n\n414\n00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:53,759\nI don't I think there's so much work to\n\n415\n00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:55,600\ndo there are so many ideas to pursue\n\n416\n00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:58,320\nthat if If I can do work more\n\n417\n00:16:55,600 --> 00:17:02,160\neffectively, I would simply do more. And\n\n418\n00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:06,640\nso I think that that that that\n\n419\n00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:07,600\noptimistic view is not naive. It's\n\n420\n00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,240\nactually history,\n\n421\n00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:10,720\n>> right?\n\n422\n00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:13,280\n>> History would suggest that humanity has\n\n423\n00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:15,839\na lot more ideas to go pursue. We have a\n\n424\n00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:17,839\nlot more challenges to go address. If we\n\n425\n00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:21,199\nshould just have more productivity, we\n\n426\n00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:23,360\ncan go get to it much faster. Well, we\n\n427\n00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:24,959\none one thing if I could just one thing\n\n428\n00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:27,520\nthat I would like to add\n\n429\n00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:29,360\n>> and this is this is um this is something\n\n430\n00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:30,799\nthat that you and I have spoken about\n\n431\n00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:36,000\nbefore.\n\n432\n00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:37,840\n>> Um it is vital that everyone engages AI\n\n433\n00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,000\nright away.\n\n434\n00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:42,080\nEvery adult,\n\n435\n00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,880\nevery working person, not working\n\n436\n00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:46,559\nperson, every child should address and\n\n437\n00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:49,120\nengage AI right away. And the reason for\n\n438\n00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:51,360\nthat is because AI is the greatest\n\n439\n00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:52,160\nequalization equalizing force.\n\n440\n00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:54,960\n>> That's a good point.\n\n441\n00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:58,080\n>> It is the first time in history that a\n\n442\n00:17:54,960 --> 00:18:01,840\ntechnology as incredible as artificial\n\n443\n00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:04,240\nintelligence is useful for someone who\n\n444\n00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:07,600\nknows how to program software, whether\n\n445\n00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:08,960\nyou program C++ or Python or you have no\n\n446\n00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:11,039\nidea how to use a computer.\n\n447\n00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:12,880\n>> Right? This is the very first time in\n\n448\n00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:14,720\nhistory that all of a sudden that\n\n449\n00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:16,880\ncomputer is easy to use. If you don't\n\n450\n00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:19,360\nknow how to use AI, just open up the\n\n451\n00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:20,160\nwebsite, go to Chad GPT, go to Gemini\n\n452\n00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,960\nPro, just say\n\n453\n00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,760\n>> ask a simple question.\n\n454\n00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:24,000\n>> Yeah.

Of course, he wants her\n\n537\n00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:21,120\nwould to continue to lead the world. In\n\n538\n00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:23,600\norder to lead the world in AI because AI\n\n539\n00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:25,039\nis fundamentally about computing and\n\n540\n00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:26,720\ncomputing is fundamentally about\n\n541\n00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:29,440\ndevelopers.\n\n542\n00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:33,039\nThe first job of leadership of a\n\n543\n00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:36,000\ncomputing platform which AI is also is\n\n544\n00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:38,640\nto win all developers.\n\n545\n00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:41,360\nThe first job of any platform is to win\n\n546\n00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:43,600\nall developers. Later when we talk about\n\n547\n00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:46,320\n5G, I can show you exactly the same\n\n548\n00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:48,880\nthing. We had a policy that caused us to\n\n549\n00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:51,120\nlose all developers.

AI\n\n557\n00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:11,360\ndevelopers are everywhere. The reason\n\n558\n00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:14,559\nwhy AI developers are everywhere is\n\n559\n00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:17,120\nbecause every country, every industry,\n\n560\n00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:18,799\nevery company needs to have intelligence\n\n561\n00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:21,520\nand wants to engage artificial\n\n562\n00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:23,679\nintelligence. But it starts with 50% are\n\n563\n00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:25,360\nin China and we need to win those\n\n564\n00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:28,880\ndevelopers. And so I think the first\n\n565\n00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:31,280\nthing he that that I would I would um\n\n566\n00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:33,120\ncontinue to say every time I I can\n\n567\n00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:36,559\nbecause the technology is not easy to\n\n568\n00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:39,520\nunderstand is if we want America to lead\n\n569\n00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:42,240\nthe AI revolution and continue to be the\n\n570\n00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:45,360\nworld leader the first thing we need is\n\n571\n00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:47,919\nevery AI developer to build on American\n\n572\n00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:48,480\ntech stack. The second thing I would say\n\n573\n00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:50,960\nis that\n\n574\n00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:53,280\n>> I think you've also said\n\n575\n00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:54,559\num you want to set the global standard\n\n576\n00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:55,919\nfor the technology stack.\n\n577\n00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:58,480\n>> That's right. The American company\n\n578\n00:22:55,919 --> 00:23:00,159\nshould be those that set the standard.\n\n579\n00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:01,200\n>> The American tech stack should be the\n\n580\n00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:03,120\nglobal standard.\n\n581\n00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:05,600\n>> Just as the American dollar is the\n\n582\n00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:08,880\nglobal standard by which every country\n\n583\n00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:11,520\nbuilds on, we should want the American\n\n584\n00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:15,919\ntech stack to be the tech stack that the\n\n585\n00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:17,840\nAI stack that everyone builds on. Now\n\n586\n00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:20,720\nthe tech stack starts with chips and\n\n587\n00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:22,960\nsystems. It is not just the AI models on\n\n588\n00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:25,360\ntop. There are many AI models on top.\n\n589\n00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:26,640\nThere's incredible models of all kinds.\n\n590\n00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:29,440\nSome of them are open source, some of\n\n591\n00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:32,080\nthem are closed, some of for physics,\n\n592\n00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:34,799\nsome of them are for uh quantum, some of\n\n593\n00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:37,520\nthem are for communications. The AI\n\n594\n00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:39,600\nmodels are of all different types. The\n\n595\n00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:42,320\nthings that you do uh your initiative\n\n596\n00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:44,000\ncalled AI plus I just deeply love. AI\n\n597\n00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:46,880\nfor science, that model is obviously\n\n598\n00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:50,159\ndifferent than a chatbot. AI for quantum\n\n599\n00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:52,159\nobviously different. AI for 5G and 6G,\n\n600\n00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:53,919\nobviously different, right? And so AI\n\n601\n00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:57,360\nfor robotics, obviously different. And\n\n602\n00:23:53,919 --> 00:24:00,480\nso all these different models are all AI\n\n603\n00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:03,120\nmodels and they should all be built\n\n604\n00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:04,960\n>> on the American tech stack. And so the\n\n605\n00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:10,320\nsecond thing that I would advocate is\n\n606\n00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:13,600\nthat AI diffusion should not be to limit\n\n607\n00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:16,480\nAmerican tech stack to the world. AI\n\n608\n00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:19,039\ndiffusion should be about maximizing the\n\n609\n00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:21,520\nAmerican tech stack all over the world\n\n610\n00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:24,480\nso that every AI developer in the world\n\n611\n00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:26,880\nbuilds on the American standard. And as\n\n612\n00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:30,240\nwe know about the computing ecosystem,\n\n613\n00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:33,600\nthe virtual cycle is incredible. the\n\n614\n00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:35,760\nmore your technology is everywhere, the\n\n615\n00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:37,440\nmore developers you're gonna have, the\n\n616\n00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:38,880\nmore developers you're going to have,\n\n617\n00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:40,400\nthe more your technology is going to be\n\n618\n00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:41,679\neverywhere. And so this positive\n\n619\n00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:43,279\nfeedback system is\n\n620\n00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:45,840\n>> I will just piggyback on this topic\n\n621\n00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:46,320\nbecause you talk a lot about sovereign\n\n622\n00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:47,120\nAI.\n\n623\n00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:49,840\n>> Yeah.\n\n624\n00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:52,159\n>> What do you mean by that? How does a\n\n625\n00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:54,640\ncountry build a sovereign AI? Why does\n\n626\n00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:56,720\nit need it for? You know, obviously the\n\n627\n00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:58,240\nway Europeans will build sovereign AI is\n\n628\n00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:00,159\ngoing to be different than how African\n\n629\n00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:02,240\ncountries are big. But you're traveling\n\n630\n00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:04,159\naround the world and advocating for\n\n631\n00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:05,120\nsovereign AI. So can you unpack your\n\n632\n00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:07,200\nvision about this?\n\n633\n00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:09,919\n>> I'm advocating for the American tech\n\n634\n00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:11,919\nstack to be the tech stack that every\n\n635\n00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:14,080\ncountry builds on. That's what I'm\n\n636\n00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:15,520\nadvocating for. And the reason the\n\n637\n00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:17,840\nreason why every country needs to build\n\n638\n00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:19,279\ntheir own tech stack, their own AI, is\n\n639\n00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:20,960\nbecause even though they could use\n\n640\n00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:23,919\nAmerican AIS, there's no question. And\n\n641\n00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:26,159\nthey should um every country should use\n\n642\n00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:29,520\nOpen AI. Every c country should use\n\n643\n00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:31,440\nGemini. um Google's Gemini and every\n\n644\n00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:34,240\ncountry should use Grock, you know, and\n\n645\n00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:36,640\nand so these are incredible models and\n\n646\n00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:38,799\nso every country should use them, but\n\n647\n00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:42,080\nthey should also build their own\n\n648\n00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:44,960\nindigenous AI stack and their AI AI\n\n649\n00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:47,600\nmodels and that AI model is trained on\n\n650\n00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:49,520\ntheir language, their history, their the\n\n651\n00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:52,480\nknowledge of their society, their\n\n652\n00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:55,279\nculture, their values. It's not sensible\n\n653\n00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:58,240\nthat one western company will be able to\n\n654\n00:25:55,279 --> 00:26:00,559\ncapture and somehow appre deeply\n\n655\n00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:02,640\nappreciate the values of every country\n\n656\n00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:04,799\nand every religion and every background\n\n657\n00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:07,039\nand every you know society around the\n\n658\n00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:09,120\nworld. And so each one of them should be\n\n659\n00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:11,919\nable to build something on their own.\n\n660\n00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:14,559\nAnd that AI model will work with other\n\n661\n00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:18,240\nindustrial AI open AI models or maybe\n\n662\n00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:20,240\neven private um uh corporate models or\n\n663\n00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:22,640\nyou know specific\n\n664\n00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:24,799\nindustrial science models or whatever it\n\n665\n00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:26,159\nis. But all of these models are going to\n\n666\n00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:28,480\ninteract. They should be able to build\n\n667\n00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:29,919\ntheir own and but still we want them to\n\n668\n00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:32,080\nbuild on American tech stack.\n\n669\n00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:34,480\n>> Yeah. You've been pretty vocal about the\n\n670\n00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:36,640\nUS China tech competition. So I want to\n\n671\n00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:38,080\nget your views about how you view the\n\n672\n00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:40,000\ncompetition. you call them a peer\n\n673\n00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:41,919\ncompetitor, not a nearper but a peer\n\n674\n00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,760\ncompetitor that have serious products,\n\n675\n00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:47,200\nserious companies. Where do you think\n\n676\n00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:52,559\nthe competition stands now?\n\n677\n00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:55,840\nUm f first of all uh China is our\n\n678\n00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:57,600\ncompetitor and adversary not our enemy.\n\n679\n00:26:55,840 --> 00:27:00,559\nAnd the reason for that is because we\n\n680\n00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:02,159\nhave we have deep interconnections and\n\n681\n00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:04,960\ninterdependencies between the two\n\n682\n00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:08,240\ncountries.\n\n683\n00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:10,400\nAmerica is incredible. Our\n\n684\n00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:12,720\ntechnology leadership\n\n685\n00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:14,400\nis extraordinary.\n\n686\n00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:17,440\nThe computer industry by which I have\n\n687\n00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:20,400\nthe honor to serve\n\n688\n00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:24,000\nis the most talented, deeply capable\n\n689\n00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:27,200\ntech industry the world's ever seen.\n\n690\n00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:29,760\nAnd I expect us to retain\n\n691\n00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:33,360\nour leadership position for decades to\n\n692\n00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:36,799\ncome. And I welcome competition.\n\n693\n00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:39,520\nLet's go. you know, competitors, come\n\n694\n00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:42,640\non, let's go play. That's the American\n\n695\n00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:46,799\nspirit. The the competitive spirit that\n\n696\n00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:49,200\nwe have um isn't lost.\n\n697\n00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:53,120\nAnd we need the opportunity as the\n\n698\n00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:55,440\nAmerican industry to go fight for\n\n699\n00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:59,039\nAmerican leadership.\n\n700\n00:27:55,440 --> 00:28:01,840\nAnd at a time when when\n\n701\n00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:03,840\ncompanies countries around the world all\n\n702\n00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:06,320\nhave capabilities, frankly, we're\n\n703\n00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:08,480\ninterdependent and we depend on the\n\n704\n00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:10,320\ncapabilities of many countries. You\n\n705\n00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:12,480\nknow, the deeper you go, the more you\n\n706\n00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:14,080\nrealized, you realize there are things\n\n707\n00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:16,399\nin Europe that we depend on. There are\n\n708\n00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:17,919\nthings in in Japan we depend on. There\n\n709\n00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:19,600\nare things in Southeast Asia we depend\n\n710\n00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:21,840\non. There's things in Latin America we\n\n711\n00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:24,320\ndepend on. You know, every country has\n\n712\n00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:26,399\ntheir specialty and their capabilities.\n\n713\n00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:28,559\nAnd China of course has formidable\n\n714\n00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:31,279\ncapabilities. Their technology companies\n\n715\n00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:33,679\nare formidable. Huawei is formidable.\n\n716\n00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:38,159\nBYD is formidable. These are incredible\n\n717\n00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:41,440\ncompanies. Their their\n\n718\n00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:47,279\nnational pride in manufacturing\n\n719\n00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:49,760\nand uh deep really deep and broad you\n\n720\n00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:51,760\nknow scale of manufacturing expertise\n\n721\n00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:54,640\ncan be undermined. It's not about labor.\n\n722\n00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:55,039\nIt's technology plus craft and labor\n\n723\n00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:55,520\nscale,\n\n724\n00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:57,279\n>> right?\n\n725\n00:28:55,520 --> 00:29:00,080\n>> The combination of those three things\n\n726\n00:28:57,279 --> 00:29:03,279\ntogether is just extraordinary. It's\n\n727\n00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:06,799\nit's something to to witness. And so we\n\n728\n00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:10,159\nwe need to realize that that um we are\n\n729\n00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:12,480\nnow in a interdependent world. Uh and so\n\n730\n00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:15,760\nwhat do we do? uh the things that we\n\n731\n00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:18,000\nshould do uh one\n\n732\n00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:20,080\nwhat President Trump's\n\n733\n00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:24,960\ninitiative President Trump's initiative\n\n734\n00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:30,080\non uh localizing or re reindustrializing\n\n735\n00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:33,919\nAmerica is just a fantastic and and\n\n736\n00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:36,480\nvisionary and timely initiative. We need\n\n737\n00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:38,960\nto we need to be world class at the\n\n738\n00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:41,120\ntechnology of manufacturing, the craft\n\n739\n00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:43,760\nof manufacturing and the labor scale of\n\n740\n00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:46,640\nmanufacturing. Again, that entire part\n\n741\n00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:49,279\nof our ecosystem is somewhat lagging and\n\n742\n00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:51,200\nwe've lost our passion for it. Uh maybe\n\n743\n00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:52,960\nit's not it maybe it's because back in\n\n744\n00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:55,679\nthe old days it was more about labor\n\n745\n00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:57,840\nthan it was about technology. Um but now\n\n746\n00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:59,600\nit's deeply technical and it's something\n\n747\n00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:02,559\nthat we could really get passionate\n\n748\n00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:04,960\nbehind. And so I I think this whole area\n\n749\n00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:07,760\nof manufacturing so that we could reduce\n\n750\n00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:10,480\nour dependency on many countries around\n\n751\n00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:12,880\nthe world reduce the temperature there\n\n752\n00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:14,640\num have more capabilities ourselves.\n\n753\n00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:16,559\nIt's great for our national security.\n\n754\n00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:20,080\nIt's great for our industries. It's\n\n755\n00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:22,399\ngreat for um for job creation. It's\n\n756\n00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:24,799\ngreat for our culture, frankly. It's\n\n757\n00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:26,880\ngreat for our society overall. And so I\n\n758\n00:30:24,799 --> 00:30:29,360\nI love that vision, President Trump's\n\n759\n00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:31,760\nvision of re-industrializing America.\n\n760\n00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:33,279\nAnd so I think that we need to do that.\n\n761\n00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:35,440\nMeanwhile,\n\n762\n00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:38,880\nwe have to get extra we have to stay\n\n763\n00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:41,600\nextraordinarily excellent in uh areas\n\n764\n00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:44,240\nlike artificial intelligence and and AI\n\n765\n00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:47,440\ncomputing and and the the tech stack so\n\n766\n00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:51,440\nthat we could be a partner to every\n\n767\n00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:53,360\ncountry in the world and um uh and and\n\n768\n00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:56,000\nmake a contribution to every country in\n\n769\n00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:58,159\nthe world so that we could have uh this\n\n770\n00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:01,200\ncontinued you know interdependency of\n\n771\n00:30:58,159 --> 00:31:02,640\neach other and uh uh you know drive our\n\n772\n00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:04,559\nindustry straight forward.\n\n773\n00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:07,279\n>> Last question. Jensen, you talk about\n\n774\n00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:10,640\nregaining strategic confidence. Is this\n\n775\n00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:12,960\nwhat that means in your words, leading,\n\n776\n00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:16,480\nkeep inventing? And by this end of this\n\n777\n00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:18,240\ndecade, American technologies have built\n\n778\n00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:20,399\nthe global infrastructure both on the\n\n779\n00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:20,880\ntech stack hardware, but as well as\n\n780\n00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:22,960\nsoftware.\n\n781\n00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:25,600\n>> Yeah, exactly. you know, most of the\n\n782\n00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:27,200\ntime most of the time regulation um\n\n783\n00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:31,520\npolicies\n\n784\n00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:34,640\nuh uh tends to be tends to tends to\n\n785\n00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:36,559\nfocus too much on limiting and\n\n786\n00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:38,720\nrestricting.\n\n787\n00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:42,640\nUm and that that's that is that is fine\n\n788\n00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:46,320\nto do. Um, I just want to remind remind\n\n789\n00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:47,840\nuh ourselves that America is\n\n790\n00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:50,000\nextraordinary\n\n791\n00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:51,360\nand that the companies here and I I have\n\n792\n00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,440\nthe benefit of working with companies\n\n793\n00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:55,279\nall over the world. Nvidia is obviously\n\n794\n00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:57,600\na global company. We have we have\n\n795\n00:31:55,279 --> 00:32:00,080\nbusinesses all over the world. Um, I can\n\n796\n00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:03,600\nattest that this country is\n\n797\n00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:06,640\nextraordinary has extraordinary\n\n798\n00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:12,399\nwork ethics. Frankly, I think Americans\n\n799\n00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:15,440\nwork, if not as hard as any hardworking\n\n800\n00:32:12,399 --> 00:32:16,960\nculture in the world, but I consider\n\n801\n00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:19,279\nmany American companies and many\n\n802\n00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:22,480\nindustries, we work the hardest of any\n\n803\n00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:25,840\nindustry.

I saw it firsthand.\n\n817\n00:32:53,919 --> 00:32:59,120\nYou know, no one has enjoyed the\n\n818\n00:32:56,080 --> 00:33:01,039\nAmerican dream and saw it personally in\n\n819\n00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:03,919\nmy lifetime\n\n820\n00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:06,080\nthan I have. You know, if if there's a\n\n821\n00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:07,919\nbook that's called the American dream,\n\n822\n00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:10,399\nI'm I might be one of the chapters,\n\n823\n00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:12,960\nright? you know, and so so this is this\n\n824\n00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:16,880\nis I embody the American dream and and\n\n825\n00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:21,840\nso I I I walk with extraordinary pride\n\n826\n00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:24,399\nand great and gratitude um and uh uh and\n\n827\n00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:28,880\nrecognizing what the magic of the of\n\n828\n00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:32,640\nAmerica and uh and also uh a great\n\n829\n00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:35,360\nconfidence about what we can do and and\n\n830\n00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:38,320\nso I think that that whatever policies\n\n831\n00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:41,039\nare created are developed\n\n832\n00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:42,640\nis to realize, you know, and this is no\n\n833\n00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:44,480\ndifferent than than companies developing\n\n834\n00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:46,960\nstrategies. Before you develop\n\n835\n00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:49,039\nstrategies about the adversary or the\n\n836\n00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:52,159\ncompetition, the first thing you have to\n\n837\n00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:55,120\ndo is know thyself.\n\n838\n00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:58,559\nAnd the the strategies that you deploy\n\n839\n00:33:55,120 --> 00:34:00,720\nwhen you're in defense versus the\n\n840\n00:33:58,559 --> 00:34:04,480\nstrategies that you deploy and policies\n\n841\n00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:06,880\nyou deploy when you are in offense are\n\n842\n00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:08,879\nrelated, not the same. And so it's\n\n843\n00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:11,280\nreally important to s get a sense of\n\n844\n00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:14,560\nwhat our what our national capabilities\n\n845\n00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:17,359\nare and especially in the field of\n\n846\n00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:19,440\nartificial intelligence and computing uh\n\n847\n00:34:17,359 --> 00:34:21,440\nto recognize what an extraordinary\n\n848\n00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:24,879\nindustry we've created somehow over the\n\n849\n00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:27,679\nyears and it is our national treasure.\n\n850\n00:34:24,879 --> 00:34:31,200\nWe should do everything we can to\n\n851\n00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:33,440\nfurther this capability to nurture this\n\n852\n00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:36,560\ncapability to protect this capability\n\n853\n00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:38,240\nand enhance it.

Tuvimos el tuvimos el\n\n90\n00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:42,319\nla pista interior en el sentido de que uh nosotros\n\n91\n00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:44,640\nSiempre creí que CUDA iba a\n\n92\n00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:47,200\npermitir una nueva clase de aplicaciones y\n\n93\n00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:50,799\nsiempre estábamos atentos a ello. Y\n\n94\n00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:53,120\nentonces cuando cuando um Alexet vino um\n\n95\n00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:56,640\nConstruido sobre CUDA, nuestras GPU lo hicieron\n\n96\n00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:59,120\nposible uh para entrenar a AlexNet y para\n\n97\n00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:01,599\nAlex Net para lograr algo tan extraordinario\n\n98\n00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:04,879\nresultados en visión por computadora, lograr el\n\n99\n00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:07,120\nnivel de capacidad que una computadora\n\n100\n00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:09,120\ncientíficos especializados en informática\n\n101\n00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:11,760\nla visión no pudo lograr más de cuatro\n\n102\n00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:15,200\ndécadas. Ya sabes, para que tres personas\n\n103\n00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:17,919\nhacer algo así. um uh es\n\n104\n00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:20,000\nsimplemente una hazaña extraordinaria. Y entonces nosotros\n\n105\n00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:21,680\naproveché la oportunidad y nos miramos\n\n106\n00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,680\n¿Qué es lo que estamos mirando? Tú\n\n107\n00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:26,240\n¿Sabes qué está pasando aquí? Es esto\n\n108\n00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:29,360\n¿Es Alec Alex al Alexnet un gran avance?\n\n109\n00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:31,440\nen visión por computadora o es más grande\n\n110\n00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:34,080\nidea que esa? Y por supuesto, como nosotros\n\n111\n00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:36,080\nYa sabes, la visión por computadora es un pilar de\n\n112\n00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:37,680\ninteligencia artificial. Sabes,\n\n113\n00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:39,280\nsin visión por computadora, sin habla\n\n114\n00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,840\ncomprensión del idioma, es difícil\n\n115\n00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:43,520\ntener inteligencia. Y entonces nosotros nosotros\n\n116\n00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:45,440\nMe di cuenta de que esto, por supuesto, era parte\n\n117\n00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,880\nde inteligencia artificial. ¿Pero es un\n\n118\n00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:49,840\n¿Una idea más grande que esa? Y llegamos a\n\n119\n00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:53,680\nla conclusión de que lo que AlexNet y\n\n120\n00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:56,880\nEl aprendizaje profundo demostró es que ahora es\n\n121\n00:04:53,680 --> 00:05:00,000\nfinalmente posible si tuviéramos suficientes datos,\n\n122\n00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:01,600\nsuficiente escala informática. Y por supuesto nosotros\n\n123\n00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,520\ntener estos modelos de aprendizaje profundo que son\n\n124\n00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:07,039\nbastante escalable\n\n125\n00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:10,000\num que podríamos ser capaces de aplicar\n\n126\n00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:12,240\ncomputadoras para resolver problemas uh que eran\n\n127\n00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,720\nimposible de describir usando humanos\n\n128\n00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:17,280\ncaracterística diseñada y utilizando principios\n\n129\n00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:19,360\nalgoritmos.

Debido a la IA\n\n531\n00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:06,799\ntambién. Y entonces vamos a hacer nuestro\n\n532\n00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:07,919\nmejor para ayudar a nuestro país a recuperarse\n\n533\n00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:10,880\nliderazgo tecnológico y\n\n534\n00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:13,360\ntelecomunicaciones. Pero volviendo a la IA, él\n\n535\n00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:15,520\nquiere que Estados Unidos sea el\n\n536\n00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:17,840\nlos mejores del mundo. Por supuesto, él la quiere.\n\n537\n00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:21,120\ncontinuaría liderando el mundo. En\n\n538\n00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:23,600\npara liderar el mundo en IA porque la IA\n\n539\n00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:25,039\ntrata fundamentalmente de informática y\n\n540\n00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:26,720\nLa informática se trata fundamentalmente de\n\n541\n00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:29,440\ndesarrolladores.\n\n542\n00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:33,039\nEl primer trabajo de liderazgo de una\n\n543\n00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:36,000\nplataforma informática que también es la IA\n\n544\n00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:38,640\npara ganar a todos los desarrolladores.\n\n545\n00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:41,360\nEl primer trabajo de cualquier plataforma es ganar\n\n546\n00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:43,600\ntodos los desarrolladores. Más tarde cuando hablamos de\n\n547\n00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:46,320\n5G, puedo mostrarte exactamente lo mismo\n\n548\n00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:48,880\ncosa. Teníamos una política que nos hizo\n\n549\n00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:51,120\nperder a todos los desarrolladores. Necesitamos tener un\n\n550\n00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:53,919\npolítica que nos permita ganarlo todo\n\n551\n00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:56,799\ndesarrolladores. 50% de la IA del mundo\n\n552\n00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:59,120\nLos desarrolladores están en China.\n\n553\n00:21:56,799 --> 00:22:01,520\nLos desarrolladores de IA están en todo el mundo.\n\n554\n00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:04,880\nSus desarrolladores de IA ahora están creciendo\n\n555\n00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:07,440\nen África, en América Latina, en\n\n556\n00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:09,280\nSudeste Asiático, en Medio Oriente. AI\n\n557\n00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:11,360\nLos desarrolladores están en todas partes. La razón\n\n558\n00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:14,559\nLa razón por la que los desarrolladores de IA están en todas partes es\n\n559\n00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:17,120\nporque cada país, cada industria,\n\n560\n00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:18,799\ntoda empresa necesita tener inteligencia\n\n561\n00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:21,520\ny quiere involucrarse artificial\n\n562\n00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:23,679\ninteligencia. Pero comienza con el 50% son\n\n563\n00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:25,360\nen China y necesitamos ganar esos\n\n564\n00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:28,880\ndesarrolladores. Y entonces creo que la primera\n\n565\n00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:31,280\ncosa el que eso lo haría lo haría um\n\n566\n00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:33,120\nsigo diciendo cada vez que puedo\n\n567\n00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:36,559\nporque la tecnología no es fácil de\n\n568\n00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:39,520\nentender es si queremos que Estados Unidos lidere\n\n569\n00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:42,240\nla revolución de la IA y seguir siendo el\n\n570\n00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:45,360\nlíder mundial lo primero que necesitamos es\n\n571\n00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:47,919\ncada desarrollador de IA se base en Estados Unidos\n\n572\n00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:48,480\npila de tecnología. La segunda cosa que diría\n\n573\n00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:50,960\nes eso\n\n574\n00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:53,280\n>> Creo que también has dicho\n\n575\n00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:54,559\num quieres establecer el estándar global\n\n576\n00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:55,919\npara la pila de tecnología.\n\n577\n00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:58,480\n>> Así es. la empresa americana\n\n578\n00:22:55,919 --> 00:23:00,159\ndeberían ser aquellos que establezcan la norma.\n\n579\n00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:01,200\n>> La pila tecnológica estadounidense debería ser la\n\n580\n00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:03,120\nestándar mundial.\n\n581\n00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:05,600\n>> Así como el dólar americano es el\n\n582\n00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:08,880\nestándar global por el cual cada país\n\n583\n00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:11,520\nse basa en, deberíamos querer que los estadounidenses\n\n584\n00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:15,919\npila de tecnología para ser la pila de tecnología que el\n\n585\n00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:17,840\nPila de IA sobre la que todos construyen. Ahora\n\n586\n00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:20,720\nla pila tecnológica comienza con chips y\n\n587\n00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:22,960\nsistemas. No se trata sólo de los modelos de IA\n\n588\n00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:25,360\narriba. Hay muchos modelos de IA además.\n\n589\n00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:26,640\nHay modelos increíbles de todo tipo.\n\n590\n00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:29,440\nAlgunos de ellos son de código abierto, otros\n\n591\n00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:32,080\nestán cerrados, algunos de física,\n\n592\n00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:34,799\nalgunos de ellos son para uh cuánticos, algunos de\n\n593\n00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:37,520\nSon para comunicaciones. La IA\n\n594\n00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:39,600\nLos modelos son de todos los tipos diferentes. El\n\n595\n00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:42,320\ncosas que haces uh tu iniciativa\n\n596\n00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:44,000\nSe llama AI plus y me encanta. AI\n\n597\n00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:46,880\npara la ciencia, ese modelo es obviamente\n\n598\n00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:50,159\ndiferente a un chatbot. IA para lo cuántico\n\n599\n00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:52,159\nobviamente diferente. IA para 5G y 6G,\n\n600\n00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:53,919\nobviamente diferente, ¿verdad? Y entonces la IA\n\n601\n00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:57,360\npara la robótica, obviamente diferente. Y\n\n602\n00:23:53,919 --> 00:24:00,480\nentonces todos estos modelos diferentes son todos IA\n\n603\n00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:03,120\nmodelos y todos deberían ser construidos\n\n604\n00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:04,960\n>> en la pila tecnológica estadounidense.
