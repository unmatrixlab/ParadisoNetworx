them at\n\n55\n00:02:14,099 --> 00:02:18,420\nfive o'clock in the afternoon and then\n\n56\n00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:19,739\nboom Hopper state they're on stage\n\n57\n00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:22,080\nsinging\n\n58\n00:02:19,739 --> 00:02:25,560\nand they get very excited and and\n\n59\n00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:28,319\nobviously but it it's a wonderful thing\n\n60\n00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:30,840\nyeah for them but also for me and also\n\n61\n00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:33,599\nfor the band have these children come\n\n62\n00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:36,720\nand perform with us on

from the local\n\n66\n00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:44,760\ncommunity and they did and they weren't\n\n67\n00:02:43,019 --> 00:02:46,920\nallowed to play so I got some other kids\n\n68\n00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:48,959\nbut what was the objection\n\n69\n00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:51,420\nthat I'm an anti-semite\n\n70\n00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:53,340\nobviously I'm not an anti so let's get\n\n71\n00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:54,959\nthat clear straight away if you don't\n\n72\n00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:58,140\nmind\n\n73\n00:02:54,959 --> 00:03:00,780\num because I'm obviously not you can\n\n74\n00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:03,540\nstudy my record going back as far as you\n\n75\n00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:05,640\nwant um\n\n76\n00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:07,980\nso that yeah that's but that's always\n\n77\n00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:10,800\nthe objection because because I support\n\n78\n00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:13,140\nBDS and because I have for the last 16\n\n79\n00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:15,959\nyears or so BDS\n\n80\n00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:19,019\nyou know what BTS is Boycott divestment\n\n81\n00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:22,620\nand sanctions okay it's a it's a\n\n82\n00:03:19,019 --> 00:03:25,260\nmovement that was started in 2005 uh in\n\n83\n00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:28,319\nPalestinian civil society and it stands\n\n84\n00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:31,319\nfor boycott divestment and sanctions\n\n85\n00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:33,360\nand uh so it's a movement to try and uh\n\n86\n00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:35,340\nshine a light on the predicament of the\n\n87\n00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:38,700\nPalestinian people\n\n88\n00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:43,099\nparticularly in the occupied territories\n\n89\n00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:43,099\num but also I guess in Israel itself\n\n90\n00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:48,120\num using those using boycott and\n\n91\n00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:50,879\ndivestment from companies that like\n\n92\n00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:52,319\nCaterpillar or Hewlett-Packard people\n\n93\n00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:55,019\nlike that\n\n94\n00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:58,019\nwho deal in the illegal settlements in\n\n95\n00:03:55,019 --> 00:04:00,420\nthe occupied territory and\n\n96\n00:03:58,019 --> 00:04:03,360\nsanctions well\n\n97\n00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:05,040\nthere is there's not not many people out\n\n98\n00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:08,099\nthere who are powerful enough to impose\n\n99\n00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:10,019\nsanctions on other people and um\n\n100\n00:04:08,099 --> 00:04:13,140\nand most of those\n\n101\n00:04:10,019 --> 00:04:14,760\nwith that much power our allies of the\n\n102\n00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:16,500\nIsraeli government and so wouldn't do so\n\n103\n00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:17,519\nbut anyway that's what it is by and\n\n104\n00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:20,280\nlarge\n\n105\n00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:22,500\nand since then we have made great\n\n106\n00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:24,660\nstrides in that movement and it's much\n\n107\n00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:27,360\nbigger movement than it was and in in\n\n108\n00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:29,880\nconsequence\n\n109\n00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:33,540\num the the sort of battle lines have\n\n110\n00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:35,820\nbeen drawn but it's got more intense and\n\n111\n00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:38,340\nit's slightly less gentlemanly sport\n\n112\n00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:41,220\nthan it was 16 years ago\n\n113\n00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:44,040\nin my experience anyway so 16 years ago\n\n114\n00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:47,460\nyou were allowed to have different\n\n115\n00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:51,240\nopinions about conflicts well no but\n\n116\n00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:53,220\nnobody knew about the conflict it was\n\n117\n00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:56,639\nlargely unknown that there was a problem\n\n118\n00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:58,919\nat all in the in in the Holy Land uh\n\n119\n00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:01,979\ncertainly by most of the public in this\n\n120\n00:04:58,919 --> 00:05:02,820\ncountry and where I'm from in the UK as\n\n121\n00:05:01,979 --> 00:05:04,680\nwell\n\n122\n00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:08,940\nand in me\n\n123\n00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:11,180\nI mean I I had accepted back in 2005 or\n\n124\n00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:14,280\nsix one of those years\n\n125\n00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:15,960\nto do to do a gig in Tel Aviv I was\n\n126\n00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:18,060\nasked in the middle of a European tour\n\n127\n00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:19,919\nhey Raj they want you to go and do a gig\n\n128\n00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:22,139\nin Tel Aviv he said and I went yeah\n\n129\n00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:24,660\nright I didn't I didn't think twice\n\n130\n00:05:22,139 --> 00:05:26,880\nabout it so that's where I was then so\n\n131\n00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:28,680\nI'm not blaming people for not having\n\n132\n00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:31,259\nknown about\n\n133\n00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:33,720\ndesigners project since 1948 and\n\n134\n00:05:31,259 --> 00:05:36,919\neverything that had happened although I\n\n135\n00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:41,520\nwas vaguely aware of the\n\n136\n00:05:36,919 --> 00:05:43,380\nor the 67 War and the 75 war and so on\n\n137\n00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:46,979\nand so I knew a little bit about the\n\n138\n00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:49,139\nhistory but I wasn't really okay\n\n139\n00:05:46,979 --> 00:05:52,380\nand that's how I learned because as soon\n\n140\n00:05:49,139 --> 00:05:55,020\nas I said I would do that gig I started\n\n141\n00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:57,300\nto receive emails\n\n142\n00:05:55,020 --> 00:06:00,000\nfrom supporters of BDS although it was\n\n143\n00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:02,039\nonly five or six months old at the time\n\n144\n00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,120\nmainly from North Africa to start with\n\n145\n00:06:02,039 --> 00:06:07,080\nbut then\n\n146\n00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:10,259\nI got an email from omaba guti who is um\n\n147\n00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:14,400\nwho was one of the sort of founding\n\n148\n00:06:10,259 --> 00:06:16,380\nforces behind the beginnings of BDS\n\n149\n00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:19,020\nand he tried to persuade me to cancel\n\n150\n00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:22,440\nthe gig in her combat which had sold out\n\n151\n00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:25,560\nof course in a few minutes you know and\n\n152\n00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:27,780\nuh eventually I was persuaded to cancel\n\n153\n00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:31,380\nthat gig but\n\n154\n00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:34,380\nas an act of compromise as I thought\n\n155\n00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:36,660\nI feel as if I'm a repeating\n\n156\n00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:38,520\na speech that I've all that's okay made\n\n157\n00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:41,100\nalready which I am that's all right I've\n\n158\n00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:43,639\nsaid this so often before anyway so I\n\n159\n00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:47,060\nmoved the gig to an ecumenical\n\n160\n00:06:43,639 --> 00:06:50,639\nagricultural community\n\n161\n00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:54,360\nin Arabic and translated

at\n\n176\n00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:28,620\nthe time of course was of course they\n\n177\n00:07:26,819 --> 00:07:30,180\nwere all Israelis because Palestinians\n\n178\n00:07:28,620 -->

called apartheid\n\n256\n00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:41,459\nand in those days you couldn't use the\n\n257\n00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:46,019\nword apartheid in relation to Israel it\n\n258\n00:10:41,459 --> 00:10:47,880\nwas completely verboten in 2006. you\n\n259\n00:10:46,019 --> 00:10:50,100\ncould not use the word you would have\n\n260\n00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:52,740\nbeen strung up in the press and\n\n261\n00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:54,779\neverywhere else and accused of being a\n\n262\n00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:57,720\nHolocaust in iron or this and that and\n\n263\n00:10:54,779 --> 00:11:01,019\nHitler and whatever now\n\n264\n00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:03,540\nvery difficult for anyone to have a\n\n265\n00:11:01,019 --> 00:11:06,899\nconversation about Israel and Palestine\n\n266\n00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:09,360\nwithout using the word apartheid because\n\n267\n00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:12,560\nit is in the Lexicon\n\n268\n00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:15,300\nand the problem is far more in the light\n\n269\n00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:17,220\nand we are looking at it more and\n\n270\n00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:21,540\nthere's more information for all of us\n\n271\n00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:25,320\nabout it than there was then that\n\n272\n00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:27,240\nis the work that BDS has done and so it\n\n273\n00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:30,300\nhas made progress and I'm glad it has\n\n274\n00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:31,920\nbecause what I desperately hope to live\n\n275\n00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:33,959\nto see\n\n276\n00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:36,480\nis a Holy Land\n\n277\n00:11:33,959 --> 00:11:38,519\nI don't care what it's called from the\n\n278\n00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:41,279\nRiver Jordan to the Sea where the people\n\n279\n00:11:38,519 --> 00:11:45,839\nall have equal religious and political\n\n280\n00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:47,640\nand social rights all of them equal\n\n281\n00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:49,140\nand so that's what I work for in the\n\n282\n00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:51,180\nmovement and maybe we should talk about\n\n283\n00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:55,500\nsomething else because I\n\n284\n00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:57,779\nI'm if you wind me up I might perhaps\n\n285\n00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:59,880\nwell I'd be happy to wind you up I mean\n\n286\n00:11:57,779 --> 00:12:01,860\nthe definition of apart that is yes it\n\n287\n00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:04,560\nis yeah it's segregation I mean that is\n\n288\n00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:06,420\nsegregation clearly yeah what is this is\n\n289\n00:12:04,560 -->

they're\n\n292\n00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:14,519\ndifferent ethnic group so the South\n\n293\n00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:17,160\nAfrican model\n\n294\n00:12:14,519 --> 00:12:19,440\nclearly applies except that\n\n295\n00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:22,140\nthe South Africans who survived the\n\n296\n00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:24,660\nSouth African model all say that the\n\n297\n00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:26,700\nIsraeli model is far worse than the\n\n298\n00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:28,459\nwhite South African model was the white\n\n299\n00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:31,800\nSouth Africans at least tried to build\n\n300\n00:12:28,459 --> 00:12:33,660\nwell they tried they've poured money in\n\n301\n00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:36,839\nfor a start trying to keep the black\n\n302\n00:12:33,660 -->

00:12:45,839\nand Mandela obviously as well both came\n\n306\n00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:48,060\nout completely and said this is a lot\n\n307\n00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:50,399\nworse than all conditions were in South\n\n308\n00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:52,620\nAfrica before apartheid so just\n\n309\n00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:54,300\ndiscussing this and having compassion\n\n310\n00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:56,880\nfor the play of the Palestinian people\n\n311\n00:12:54,300 --> 00:13:01,200\nthat that made them categorize you as\n\n312\n00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:02,940\nanti-semitic yeah did anyone have

00:24:46,620\nmisery and pain\n\n592\n00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:49,080\nand the lack of anything\n\n593\n00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:51,059\ngood at the end\n\n594\n00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:54,120\nand the more it and the more it\n\n595\n00:24:51,059 --> 00:24:57,120\nescalates the more we send arms the more\n\n596\n00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:59,900\nPutin the less the only thing that they\n\n597\n00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:03,659\ncan do is start to talk to one another\n\n598\n00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:05,480\njust like JFK and Nikita Khrushchev did\n\n599\n00:25:03,659 --> 00:25:08,880\nin 1962.\n\n600\n00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:12,179\nduring the Cuban Missile Crisis\n\n601\n00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:15,960\nwhich was Kept Secret for years and\n\n602\n00:25:12,179 --> 00:25:18,000\nyears afterwards because JFK didn't want\n\n603\n00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:20,280\nto look like a wimp he didn't want to\n\n604\n00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:22,320\nlook as if he'd look at but he did he\n\n605\n00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:25,200\nand Nikita Khrushchev spoke on the\n\n606\n00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:28,140\ntelephone often and at the end of it\n\n607\n00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:31,440\nthey did a quid pro quo deal\n\n608\n00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:33,539\nwhere JFK said I'll take all our medium\n\n609\n00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:35,400\nrange missiles out of turkey and\n\n610\n00:25:33,539 --> 00:25:36,299\nwherever else it was Turkey was the main\n\n611\n00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:39,539\none\n\n612\n00:25:36,299 --> 00:25:41,340\nif you take your missiles out of Cuba\n\n613\n00:25:39,539 --> 00:25:42,900\nso they put the hands across the ocean\n\n614\n00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:44,159\nand shook hands and that was the end of\n\n615\n00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:46,799\nit\n\n616\n00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:50,039\nand they did it and they kept their word\n\n617\n00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:52,260\nthey kept their word to that bargain and\n\n618\n00:25:50,039 --> 00:25:54,240\nthat led on to the later conversations\n\n619\n00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:56,159\nbetween Reagan and Gorbachev and the\n\n620\n00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:59,880\nnon-proliferation treaties and all the\n\n621\n00:25:56,159 --> 00:26:02,580\nother things that made our planet a\n\n622\n00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:05,159\nlittle bit safer from the possibility of\n\n623\n00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:07,320\nnuclear catastrophe not safe but a\n\n624\n00:26:05,159 --> 00:26:09,659\nlittle bit until now\n\n625\n00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:12,419\nand now\n\n626\n00:26:09,659 --> 00:26:14,340\nby the second it gets more and more and\n\n627\n00:26:12,419 --> 00:26:16,140\nmore and more dangerous as this thing is\n\n628\n00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:18,059\nallowed to escalate\n\n629\n00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:20,460\nso I'm making my

you\n\n698\n00:28:55,980 --> 00:29:00,000\nbrought up the fact that China hasn't\n\n699\n00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:02,400\ninvaded anyone in over a hundred years\n\n700\n00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:04,500\nlike how can you say that when you know\n\n701\n00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:05,880\nabout all the interventionalist foreign\n\n702\n00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:07,799\npolicy decisions that the

--> 00:30:42,720\nsurprisingly it's packed with everything\n\n740\n00:30:39,299 --> 00:30:45,299\nthat you make chips out of course it's\n\n741\n00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:47,520\npacked and packed with it's an absolute\n\n742\n00:30:45,299 --> 00:30:49,320\nit's I nearly said it's a gold mine well\n\n743\n00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:51,720\nit's not a gold mine it's a mineral mine\n\n744\n00:30:49,320

they should be allowed to do\n\n765\n00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:44,760\nbusiness with whoever they want I\n\n766\n00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:48,360\nbelieve in the idea of what's called\n\n767\n00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:50,760\nfree trade up to that point but\n\n768\n00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:53,039\nit has there has to be a fair crack of\n\n769\n00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:55,799\nthe whip of everybody and by and large\n\n770\n00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:58,380\nwhen multicult you know multinational\n\n771\n00:31:55,799 --> 00:32:00,539\ncorporations want to invest in\n\n772\n00:31:58,380 --> 00:32:03,120\nunderdeveloped countries they want to do\n\n773\n00:32:00,539 --> 00:32:04,919\nit on their terms they don't want the\n\n774\n00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:07,559\npeople who live there to get anything\n\n775\n00:32:04,919 --> 00:32:10,020\nout of it I mean I've been involved in a\n\n776\n00:32:07,559 --> 00:32:13,200\ncourt battle for at least 10 years now\n\n777\n00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:16,380\nwith Chevron because of the pollution\n\n778\n00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:19,559\nthat they caused in the in the Amazon\n\n779\n00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:22,440\nwe're in north in North\n\n780\n00:32:19,559 --> 00:32:23,700\nEast Ecuador\n\n781\n00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:26,100\num with a friend of mine called Steve\n\n782\n00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:29,279\ndonziger who was sent to prison yes for\n\n783\n00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:31,679\nacting on behalf of these people I know\n\n784\n00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:34,440\nI'm digressing but that the dancer cases\n\n785\n00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:37,620\natrocious yeah it's a terrifying case\n\n786\n00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:39,059\nbecause there's no reason why they had\n\n787\n00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:40,559\nthat man in prison and there's there's\n\n788\n00:32:39,059 --> 00:32:42,600\nno reason why they keep him under house\n\n789\n00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:45,360\narrest well there is a reason yeah right\n\n790\n00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:48,240\nbut no righteous no legal reasons no\n\n791\n00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:49,919\nlegal reason no yeah righteous that's\n\n792\n00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:51,840\ninteresting because that comes to back\n\n793\n00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:54,539\nto my mother yeah and doing the right\n\n794\n00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:57,899\nthing yeah obviously the right thing to\n\n795\n00:32:54,539 --> 00:33:00,539\ndo if you were the law in the United\n\n796\n00:32:57,899 --> 00:33:01,980\nStates would be to look at look at the\n\n797\n00:33:00,539 --> 00:33:04,860\nfacts of the matter\n\n798\n00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:07,500\nand come to the conclusion that Chevron\n\n799\n00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:10,020\nshould give the 9.5 billion dollars to\n\n800\n00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:12,659\nthe people whose lives they've destroyed\n\n801\n00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:14,279\nmaking money or Texaco was the company\n\n802\n00:33:12,659 --> 00:33:16,799\nwho actually did it\n\n803\n00:33:14,279 --> 00:33:18,720\nbut things being what they are that's\n\n804\n00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:21,899\nnot the way the law works the law\n\n805\n00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:23,820\noperates to support whoever can afford\n\n806\n00:33:21,899 --> 00:33:25,620\nit actually which in this case is\n\n807\n00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:27,659\nChevron they still haven't paid a penny\n\n808\n00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:29,760\nand they're still fighting and they will\n\n809\n00:33:27,659 --> 00:33:31,200\ngo on fighting\n\n810\n00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:32,880\nand speaking of somebody who's\n\n811\n00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:36,000\nsupporting the other side who doesn't\n\n812\n00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:39,059\nhave bottomless pockets is\n\n813\n00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:42,480\nit's hard to find that though that the\n\n814\n00:33:39,059 --> 00:33:45,059\namount of money that they spend on it is\n\n815\n00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:47,340\nbecause they're worried of a domino\n\n816\n00:33:45,059 --> 00:33:48,840\neffect that if they lose this case then\n\n817\n00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:50,159\nthey're going to lose the case in\n\n818\n00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:52,980\nNigeria and they're going to lose the\n\n819\n00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:54,539\ncase in Australia and then suddenly they\n\n820\n00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:56,220\ncan see the whole pack of cards\n\n821\n00:33:54,539 --> 00:33:58,740\nbeginning to collapse well it should\n\n822\n00:33:56,220 --> 00:34:01,140\ncollapse pay up you've been you've made\n\n823\n00:33:58,740 --> 00:34:03,299\nenough profits out of the indigenous\n\n824\n00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:04,740\npeople all over the world which is a\n\n825\n00:34:03,299 --> 00:34:06,539\nscary precedent that they were able to\n\n826\n00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:08,520\narrest Dyson girl like that and they\n\n827\n00:34:06,539 --> 00:34:09,839\nwere able to keep them in jail what the\n\n828\n00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:13,679\nway they did it yeah and it was\n\n829\n00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:16,200\ncompletely corrupt they did back in 2014\n\n830\n00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:19,919\nthey produced a RICO trial which is you\n\n831\n00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:21,419\nknow is organized crime it's\n\n832\n00:34:19,919 --> 00:34:24,179\num regulations or something against\n\n833\n00:34:21,419 --> 00:34:26,879\norganized crime so so they pretended he\n\n834\n00:34:24,179 --> 00:34:28,919\nwas a gangster on a fraudulent Mission\n\n835\n00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:31,679\nand they brought this case in the\n\n836\n00:34:28,919 --> 00:34:35,280\nSouthern Southern District of New York\n\n837\n00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:38,220\nincredible that they could do it\n\n838\n00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:40,440\num the media is ignoring it too that\n\n839\n00:34:38,220 --> 00:34:42,300\nthis isn't so what else were absolutely\n\n840\n00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:44,879\noutraged well what isn't the media\n\n841\n00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:46,980\nignoring the on the media with the\n\n842\n00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:49,379\npossible exception of you\n\n843\n00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:51,899\nand some others who have great podcasts\n\n844\n00:34:49,379 --> 00:34:54,179\nas well but are independent of the\n\n845\n00:34:51,899 --> 00:34:57,480\nmainstream media the media only has one\n\n846\n00:34:54,179 --> 00:35:00,660\nmessage which is support the status quo\n\n847\n00:34:57,480 --> 00:35:02,400\nright we all of us work for whoever it\n\n848\n00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:05,640\nmay be and we don't need to get all\n\n849\n00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:08,520\nconspiracy theory about you know secret\n\n850\n00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:10,260\nsocieties we know it's very it's the\n\n851\n00:35:08,520 -->

--> 00:35:20,640\nruling class because they are the ruling\n\n855\n00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:23,160\nclass and we all do what we're told by\n\n856\n00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:26,160\nthe media who by and large repeat the\n\n857\n00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:28,619\nsame Mantra over and over again\n\n858\n00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:32,040\nso it's a bit tricky\n\n859\n00:35:28,619 --> 00:35:34,020\nYeah the more the media has failed in\n\n860\n00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:35,880\ntheir objective dissemination of\n\n861\n00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:38,280\ninformation that doesn't exist anymore\n\n862\n00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:40,800\nthey're bought and paid by the\n\n863\n00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:43,740\nadvertisers and the advertisers are\n\n864\n00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:46,079\nenormously powerful and so things like\n\n865\n00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:49,560\nthat that are inconvenient realities\n\n866\n00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:52,079\nlike the dosinger trial they just swept\n\n867\n00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:54,060\nunder the rug yeah which it should be\n\n868\n00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:58,020\noutrageous it should be something that's\n\n869\n00:35:54,060 --> 00:36:00,420\non well it is outrageous of

00:57:56,460\nand bribery and all this crazy [ __ ]\n\n1398\n00:57:54,180 --> 00:57:58,339\nthat's supposedly in that laptop so the\n\n1399\n00:57:56,460 --> 00:58:00,960\nFBI contacts\n\n1400\n00:57:58,339 --> 00:58:03,380\nFacebook and tells them that there's\n\n1401\n00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:07,079\ngoing to be some Russian disinformation\n\n1402\n00:58:03,380 --> 00:58:09,839\nleading towards the election and they I\n\n1403\n00:58:07,079 --> 00:58:11,880\ndon't believe he specifically said that\n\n1404\n00:58:09,839 --> 00:58:14,160\nthat laptop was a part of it but they\n\n1405\n00:58:11,880 --> 00:58:16,800\ncertainly were insinuating that and then\n\n1406\n00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:19,380\nthey decided to limit the engagement\n\n1407\n00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:21,660\nthat people had with that that's very\n\n1408\n00:58:19,380 --> 00:58:24,240\nvague I don't know what he was saying\n\n1409\n00:58:21,660 --> 00:58:26,760\nwhen he said that but my perspective was\n\n1410\n00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:29,700\nnow imagine if you were him and you're\n\n1411\n00:58:26,760 --> 00:58:33,359\nrunning something like Facebook you are\n\n1412\n00:58:29,700 --> 00:58:36,540\nfirst of all you're insanely busy and if\n\n1413\n00:58:33,359 --> 00:58:38,880\nyou have trust and faith in the FBI and\n\n1414\n00:58:36,540 --> 00:58:40,140\nthe intelligence agencies

way Twitter\n\n1420\n00:58:49,559 --> 00:58:53,640\ndid which I think is pretty egregious\n\n1421\n00:58:51,119 --> 00:58:55,020\nbut what he did do is limit its\n\n1422\n00:58:53,640 --> 00:58:57,660\nengagement I don't know what that that\n\n1423\n00:58:55,020 --> 00:58:59,220\nmeans the problem with that term like\n\n1424\n00:58:57,660 --> 00:59:01,079\nlimiting the engagement like how are you\n\n1425\n00:58:59,220 --> 00:59:03,900\ndoing that what does that mean you tell\n\n1426\n00:59:01,079 --> 00:59:07,980\nme what you do and they don't they don't\n\n1427\n00:59:03,900 -->

00:59:20,099\nput that story on your page it would\n\n1433\n00:59:18,420 --> 00:59:22,020\njust limit the amount of people who see\n\n1434\n00:59:20,099 --> 00:59:23,700\nit but I don't understand how you're\n\n1435\n00:59:22,020 --> 00:59:27,059\ndoing that like and I don't think they\n\n1436\n00:59:23,700 --> 00:59:29,880\nwant to reveal that either well the fact\n\n1437\n00:59:27,059 --> 00:59:33,359\nis in my view what's really dangerous is\n\n1438\n00:59:29,880 --> 00:59:35,339\nthat this prick has any hand at all in\n\n1439\n00:59:33,359 --> 00:59:36,960\ndeciding what any of us

right but but\n\n1448\n00:59:54,480 --> 00:59:58,799\nanything and certainly anything to do\n\n1449\n00:59:56,880 --> 01:00:01,760\nwith foreign for instance anything to do\n\n1450\n00:59:58,799 --> 01:00:04,380\nwith the Ukraine war you can't have meta\n\n1451\n01:00:01,760 --> 01:00:06,540\ndeciding what we should believe about\n\n1452\n01:00:04,380 --> 01:00:09,240\nthat it's bad enough that the whole of\n\n1453\n01:00:06,540 --> 01:00:12,180\nthe print section of mainstream made it\n\n1454\n01:00:09,240 --> 01:00:14,460\nand all television has decided what we\n\n1455\n01:00:12,180 --> 01:00:16,520\nshould believe about the Ukraine so\n\n1456\n01:00:14,460 --> 01:00:19,859\nthere are they're all completely happy\n\n1457\n01:00:16,520 --> 01:00:22,260\nto tell us that Russian soldiers have\n\n1458\n01:00:19,859 --> 01:00:24,540\nbeen raping babies to death and you know\n\n1459\n01:00:22,260 --> 01:00:26,700\nand then three days later you find out\n\n1460\n01:00:24,540 --> 01:00:28,859\nthat it's unattributable and where did\n\n1461\n01:00:26,700 --> 01:00:31,920\nthat story come from and it came from\n\n1462\n01:00:28,859 --> 01:00:33,960\nsome nebulous site somewhere in the\n\n1463\n01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:36,240\nUkraine and that so but nevertheless\n\n1464\n01:00:33,960 --> 01:00:37,799\nit's already been printed and it goes\n\n1465\n01:00:36,240 --> 01:00:40,799\nsomewhere into the Consciousness you\n\n1466\n01:00:37,799 --> 01:00:43,740\nbuild up this thing of this is we can\n\n1467\n01:00:40,799 --> 01:00:45,240\nreally hate these people enough so that\n\n1468\n01:00:43,740 --> 01:00:47,160\npeople are now saying we should just\n\n1469\n01:00:45,240 --> 01:00:49,859\nkill them all now we should start the\n\n1470\n01:00:47,160 --> 01:00:51,900\nnuclear war now right some prick on\n\n1471\n01:00:49,859 --> 01:00:53,819\nTwitter yesterday said Seaman or\n\n1472\n01:00:51,900 --> 01:00:56,700\nsomething his name I only know that\n\n1473\n01:00:53,819 --> 01:00:57,900\nbecause I've seen the Tweet what do you\n\n1474\n01:00:56,700 --> 01:01:00,180\nthink what did he say that we should\n\n1475\n01:00:57,900 --> 01:01:02,280\nactually go to war yeah yeah go to\n\n1476\n01:01:00,180 --> 01:01:04,920\nnuclear war and wipe them all out\n\n1477\n01:01:02,280 --> 01:01:06,960\nbecause he said we've been threatened\n\n1478\n01:01:04,920 --> 01:01:08,700\nthe only thing to do is to wipe them out\n\n1479\n01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:10,859\nnow what is this person's position in\n\n1480\n01:01:08,700 --> 01:01:13,260\nlife I'd have to look it up on Twitter\n\n1481\n01:01:10,859 --> 01:01:16,940\nno idea was it a journalist was it a no\n\n1482\n01:01:13,260 --> 01:01:16,940\nI I don't know do you know what it is\n\n1483\n01:01:18,440 --> 01:01:23,220\nI wonder how many people say things like\n\n1484\n01:01:21,359 --> 01:01:24,599\nthat just to get attention and likes and\n\n1485\n01:01:23,220 --> 01:01:26,579\njust to get views because I think that's\n\n1486\n01:01:24,599 --> 01:01:28,440\na big part of what Twitter is it's like\n\n1487\n01:01:26,579 --> 01:01:30,119\nlook at me he's going to say something\n\n1488\n01:01:28,440 --> 01:01:32,160\noutrageous well yeah you could be right\n\n1489\n01:01:30,119 --> 01:01:34,020\nabout that and you probably I'm sure you\n\n1490\n01:01:32,160 --> 01:01:36,720\nare right I'm sure there's a lot of Look\n\n1491\n01:01:34,020 --> 01:01:40,559\nAt Me involved in a lot of these posts\n\n1492\n01:01:36,720 --> 01:01:42,780\nthat go out and also a lot of what we'll\n\n1493\n01:01:40,559 --> 01:01:44,880\nthink what will people think of me which\n\n1494\n01:01:42,780 --> 01:01:46,799\nis the whole if you think about it all\n\n1495\n01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:48,720\nof this if it all developed from the\n\n1496\n01:01:46,799 --> 01:01:50,760\nbeginnings of Facebook and for what for\n\n1497\n01:01:48,720 --> 01:01:54,359\nwhatever that site was that Zuckerberg\n\n1498\n01:01:50,760 --> 01:01:56,579\nstarted with grading co-eds that's sort\n\n1499\n01:01:54,359 --> 01:01:58,680\nof the beginning of it and the fomo and\n\n1500\n01:01:56,579 --> 01:02:00,660\nthe this and that and sending pictures\n\n1501\n01:01:58,680 --> 01:02:02,400\nof yourself to your friends and caring\n\n1502\n01:02:00,660 --> 01:02:04,680\nwhat your schoolmates think about and\n\n1503\n01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:09,059\nall of that and it blowing up into\n\n1504\n01:02:04,680 --> 01:02:11,400\nsomething that is far far far more\n\n1505\n01:02:09,059 --> 01:02:14,460\nimportant than your mother telling you\n\n1506\n01:02:11,400 --> 01:02:16,260\nread as much as you can get educated\n\n1507\n01:02:14,460 --> 01:02:19,020\nmake sure you know what you're talking\n\n1508\n01:02:16,260 --> 01:02:20,520\nabout and do the right thing which is\n\n1509\n01:02:19,020 --> 01:02:22,559\nbecause none of them are telling us to\n\n1510\n01:02:20,520 --> 01:02:24,599\ndo that that would be wonderful if your\n\n1511\n01:02:22,559 --> 01:02:26,400\nmother ran Facebook that would be great\n\n1512\n01:02:24,599 --> 01:02:27,839\nI think the world would genuinely be a\n\n1513\n01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:29,880\nbetter place it would definitely be\n\n1514\n01:02:27,839 --> 01:02:31,799\nexcept she'd never do it of course\n\n1515\n01:02:29,880 --> 01:02:33,660\nbecause she'd go Roger if you think I'm\n\n1516\n01:02:31,799 --> 01:02:36,299\ngonna waste my time with something as\n\n1517\n01:02:33,660 --> 01:02:39,299\nflimsy as Facebook you've got another\n\n1518\n01:02:36,299 --> 01:02:41,220\nthing coming darling but what I tried to\n\n1519\n01:02:39,299 --> 01:02:43,140\nget from him and what I wanted to try to\n\n1520\n01:02:41,220 --> 01:02:45,299\nunderstand is like what is it like when\n\n1521\n01:02:43,140 --> 01:02:46,980\nyou create something that literally is\n\n1522\n01:02:45,299 --> 01:02:48,420\njust a social network you're just\n\n1523\n01:02:46,980 --> 01:02:50,640\nsupposed to be socializing with people\n\n1524\n01:02:48,420 --> 01:02:52,859\nand sharing photographs which is pretty\n\n1525\n01:02:50,640 --> 01:02:55,440\ninnocuous and then it becomes something\n\n1526\n01:02:52,859 --> 01:02:57,180\nthat can influence elections and foreign\n\n1527\n01:02:55,440 --> 01:02:58,799\npolicy and the way the the world is\n\n1528\n01:02:57,180 --> 01:03:02,579\nviewed and the way narratives are spun\n\n1529\n01:02:58,799 --> 01:03:04,260\nand you know it's a daunting task and\n\n1530\n01:03:02,579 --> 01:03:06,180\nespecially when you didn't set out to do\n\n1531\n01:03:04,260 --> 01:03:07,740\nthat in the beginning nor did Twitter\n\n1532\n01:03:06,180 --> 01:03:09,480\nTwitter set out to just be something\n\n1533\n01:03:07,740 --> 01:03:12,660\nwhere you just post oh I'm going to the\n\n1534\n01:03:09,480 --> 01:03:14,880\nmovies today and then it became what it\n\n1535\n01:03:12,660 --> 01:03:17,520\nis now because people realize well this\n\n1536\n01:03:14,880 --> 01:03:20,359\nis a tool to distribute information and\n\n1537\n01:03:17,520 --> 01:03:22,680\nyou can just put up anything and now\n\n1538\n01:03:20,359 --> 01:03:24,480\nshould we just limit that information\n\n1539\n01:03:22,680 --> 01:03:28,200\nand that's what they've decided to do\n\n1540\n01:03:24,480 --> 01:03:30,480\nthey've decided to take this moral and\n\n1541\n01:03:28,200 --> 01:03:32,940\nethical position and impose their own\n\n1542\n01:03:30,480 --> 01:03:36,540\nideas and what should or should not be\n\n1543\n01:03:32,940 --> 01:03:38,640\nsaid but all based at some point\n\n1544\n01:03:36,540 --> 01:03:40,440\non that position that they want to go on\n\n1545\n01:03:38,640 --> 01:03:42,299\ngetting richer and richer and richer and\n\n1546\n01:03:40,440 --> 01:03:44,099\nthey want meta to be the biggest company\n\n1547\n01:03:42,299 --> 01:03:46,400\nin the world and to own everything else\n\n1548\n01:03:44,099 --> 01:03:49,380\nand then they really will rule the world\n\n1549\n01:03:46,400 --> 01:03:52,380\nthat's the I think that's the mental\n\n1550\n01:03:49,380 --> 01:03:52,380\naberration\n\n1551\n01:03:52,880 --> 01:03:57,780\nor excuse me every uh Corporation they\n\n1552\n01:03:56,040 --> 01:03:59,700\nwant to continue growing and getting\n\n1553\n01:03:57,780 --> 01:04:01,799\nbigger yeah and you have shareholders\n\n1554\n01:03:59,700 --> 01:04:03,420\nand they demand that you make more money\n\n1555\n01:04:01,799 --> 01:04:06,119\nnext quarter than you made this quarter\n\n1556\n01:04:03,420 --> 01:04:07,619\nand if you don't you are not doing your\n\n1557\n01:04:06,119 --> 01:04:09,780\nresponsibility funnily enough there's\n\n1558\n01:04:07,619 --> 01:04:12,119\ngroups of Chevron shareholders are going\n\n1559\n01:04:09,780 --> 01:04:14,280\nto the AGM now and telling them to pay\n\n1560\n01:04:12,119 -->

01:07:33,059\nhe killed a million people not on his\n\n1650\n01:07:30,839 --> 01:07:34,920\nown obviously the rest of the neocons\n\n1651\n01:07:33,059 --> 01:07:37,619\nwere without poor wolfowitz

it was a\n\n1657\n01:07:45,420 --> 01:07:48,839\nlie they all knew it was nonsense they\n\n1658\n01:07:47,220 --> 01:07:50,400\nall knew they were doing it to steal oil\n\n1659\n01:07:48,839 --> 01:07:52,859\nor whatever they were doing it for but\n\n1660\n01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:54,720\nit certainly had nothing to do with 911\n\n1661\n01:07:52,859 --> 01:07:56,640\nand it had nothing to do

thing my my\n\n1735\n01:10:51,780 --> 01:10:55,800\ntheory would be\n\n1736\n01:10:53,400 --> 01:10:56,960\nwhere if you go and see George Bush he\n\n1737\n01:10:55,800 --> 01:10:59,340\nis still alive\n\n1738\n01:10:56,960 --> 01:11:01,500\nwell if you go and see him you could\n\n1739\n01:10:59,340 --> 01:11:03,300\ndrive there from here why don't you\n\n1740\n01:11:01,500 --> 01:11:05,719\ndrive over there I think they'd probably\n\n1741\n01:11:03,300 --> 01:11:05,719\nshoot me\n\n1742\n01:11:07,080 --> 01:11:11,100\na drive to George Bush's house well

he never\n\n1748\n01:11:19,260 --> 01:11:24,780\nescaped from the dynasty you know from\n\n1749\n01:11:22,260 --> 01:11:28,199\nhis genes whatever from that family\n\n1750\n01:11:24,780 --> 01:11:30,540\nbecause it's his supremely toxic\n\n1751\n01:11:28,199 --> 01:11:33,000\nbackground to come out of I.E Bush\n\n1752\n01:11:30,540 --> 01:11:35,340\nsenior all that [ __ ] about

you\n\n1965\n01:19:51,360 --> 01:19:55,020\ncould watch on YouTube yeah\n\n1966\n01:19:53,100 --> 01:19:56,760\nthere's there's a lyric in a new another\n\n1967\n01:19:55,020 --> 01:20:00,060\nnew

01:20:05,400\nI'd say\n\n1971\n01:20:02,460 --> 01:20:08,580\num in Timbuktu or in\n\n1972\n01:20:05,400 --> 01:20:11,100\nthe Republic of the Congo or and other\n\n1973\n01:20:08,580 --> 01:20:13,679\nstates where\n\n1974\n01:20:11,100 --> 01:20:15,600\nsome things I can't remember I'd have to\n\n1975\n01:20:13,679 --> 01:20:18,659\nlook it up but it's it's saying wait for\n\n1976\n01:20:15,600 --> 01:20:22,020\nthe old slave trade to merge seamlessly\n\n1977\n01:20:18,659 --> 01:20:24,120\nwith the new so I'm making that point\n\n1978\n01:20:22,020 --> 01:20:26,120\nthat that this foreign policy is\n\n1979\n01:20:24,120 --> 01:20:29,159\nreintroducing\n\n1980\n01:20:26,120 --> 01:20:32,760\nslavery to the world\n\n1981\n01:20:29,159 --> 01:20:36,120\nand reintroducing the slave trade in\n\n1982\n01:20:32,760 --> 01:20:38,640\nAfrica North Africa West Africa and the\n\n1983\n01:20:36,120 --> 01:20:41,400\nMiddle East that's what it's doing\n\n1984\n01:20:38,640 --> 01:20:43,980\nand um and people seem to think it's all\n\n1985\n01:20:41,400 --> 01:20:48,179\nright but what what's the what's it for\n\n1986\n01:20:43,980 --> 01:20:50,940\nwell why what is it even if you go in\n\n1987\n01:20:48,179 --> 01:20:53,699\nI've written another letter to\n\n1988\n01:20:50,940 --> 01:20:56,040\nsomebody which I haven't posted yet

because he\n\n1994\n01:21:08,520 --> 01:21:12,020\nclaims I'm a Putin apologist and so all\n\n1995\n01:21:11,219 --> 01:21:14,340\nmy\n\n1996\n01:21:12,020 --> 01:21:17,159\nasking everybody that I

it\n\n2007\n01:21:37,440 --> 01:21:42,659\nbut it will come back to me that's how\n\n2008\n01:21:39,600 --> 01:21:46,440\nmy brain works unfortunately\n\n2009\n01:21:42,659 --> 01:21:49,860\nhow what is your creative process when\n\n2010\n01:21:46,440 --> 01:21:52,199\nwhen you sit down to write music when\n\n2011\n01:21:49,860 --> 01:21:55,679\nyou sit down to compose songs like\n\n2012\n01:21:52,199 --> 01:21:58,199\nhow how do you go about that\n\n2013\n01:21:55,679 --> 01:22:00,780\nI always used to say for years and years\n\n2014\n01:21:58,199 --> 01:22:02,940\nI used to I don't go about it or I\n\n2015\n01:22:00,780 --> 01:22:05,820\nhaven't in the past\n\n2016\n01:22:02,940 --> 01:22:08,940\nin the past my answer would always be I\n\n2017\n01:22:05,820 --> 01:22:10,440\ndon't do anything until I get a pregnant\n\n2018\n01:22:08,940 --> 01:22:14,159\nfeeling\n\n2019\n01:22:10,440 --> 01:22:16,140\nand I can't describe the feeling except\n\n2020\n01:22:14,159 --> 01:22:18,300\nthat I know that I'm about to give birth\n\n2021\n01:22:16,140 --> 01:22:21,960\nto something so that's as close as I can\n\n2022\n01:22:18,300 --> 01:22:25,140\nget it's a weird sort of\n\n2023\n01:22:21,960 --> 01:22:27,659\nfog of nothingness that feels as if it\n\n2024\n01:22:25,140 --> 01:22:30,060\nmight clear and I might see something or\n\n2025\n01:22:27,659 --> 01:22:33,060\nsomething might pop out and very often\n\n2026\n01:22:30,060 --> 01:22:35,219\nafter that I put myself in in a\n\n2027\n01:22:33,060 --> 01:22:38,640\nphysically in the same room as a guitar\n\n2028\n01:22:35,219 --> 01:22:39,659\nor a piano and with a legal pad and a\n\n2029\n01:22:38,640 --> 01:22:42,420\nbarrow\n\n2030\n01:22:39,659 --> 01:22:44,400\nand hey Presto sometimes something pops\n\n2031\n01:22:42,420 --> 01:22:46,860\nout and I go oh that's interesting and\n\n2032\n01:22:44,400 --> 01:22:49,320\nthen I work on it more recently when\n\n2033\n01:22:46,860 --> 01:22:51,659\nkovid happened I did two things one I\n\n2034\n01:22:49,320 --> 01:22:54,179\nwrote some songs that had been bubbling\n\n2035\n01:22:51,659 --> 01:22:56,580\na bit and that might it might be just a\n\n2036\n01:22:54,179 --> 01:22:58,500\nlittle guitar riff or a chord sequence\n\n2037\n01:22:56,580 --> 01:23:00,179\nor something and then I might play it\n\n2038\n01:22:58,500 --> 01:23:02,820\nand then\n\n2039\n01:23:00,179 --> 01:23:06,360\nmy brain is a very fertile praise for\n\n2040\n01:23:02,820 --> 01:23:09,060\nideas and for lyrics and for\n\n2041\n01:23:06,360 --> 01:23:11,159\nThe Way lyrics scan against bits of\n\n2042\n01:23:09,060 --> 01:23:13,739\nmusic so it comes kind of quite easily\n\n2043\n01:23:11,159 --> 01:23:16,080\nonce I've had a first idea I did that\n\n2044\n01:23:13,739 --> 01:23:16,800\nbut also I\n\n2045\n01:23:16,080 --> 01:23:18,360\num\n\n2046\n01:23:16,800 --> 01:23:20,100\nI thought\n\n2047\n01:23:18,360 --> 01:23:22,560\nI've got a couple of years of this I've\n\n2048\n01:23:20,100 --> 01:23:25,320\nbeen meaning to write a memoir\n\n2049\n01:23:22,560 --> 01:23:27,600\nso I'm gonna do it now\n\n2050\n01:23:25,320 --> 01:23:30,060\nso one day I got this out and I went\n\n2051\n01:23:27,600 --> 01:23:33,480\nwell go on their new brick\n\n2052\n01:23:30,060 --> 01:23:35,520\ngo on then clever Vlogs so I opened a\n\n2053\n01:23:33,480 --> 01:23:37,860\nWord document and I went\n\n2054\n01:23:35,520 --> 01:23:40,020\nand I started to write and before I knew\n\n2055\n01:23:37,860 --> 01:23:42,719\nit I'd written 10 000 words and I went\n\n2056\n01:23:40,020 --> 01:23:45,179\nand I was probably a bit drunk and so I\n\n2057\n01:23:42,719 --> 01:23:48,120\nwent oh and I went back a couple of days\n\n2058\n01:23:45,179 --> 01:23:50,940\nlater and I went bloody hell it's prose\n\n2059\n01:23:48,120 --> 01:23:53,580\nand it's quite funny but it's deep as\n\n2060\n01:23:50,940 --> 01:23:56,280\nwell and it's actually rather moving\n\n2061\n01:23:53,580 --> 01:23:59,040\nand so I had a Eureka moment you know I\n\n2062\n01:23:56,280 --> 01:24:01,440\nwent [ __ ] me I could write Pro I\n\n2063\n01:23:59,040 --> 01:24:05,820\ncouldn't believe it because I love prose\n\n2064\n01:24:01,440 --> 01:24:09,000\nI mean I love to read books I love books\n\n2065\n01:24:05,820 --> 01:24:11,400\nbut you never sit down intentionally to\n\n2066\n01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:13,440\nwrite like that I never sit down like\n\n2067\n01:24:11,400 --> 01:24:15,540\nyou know professional writers sometimes\n\n2068\n01:24:13,440 --> 01:24:17,280\nthey say I get up at six every morning\n\n2069\n01:24:15,540 -->

01:32:14,460\nbecome bolder\n\n2265\n01:32:11,219 --> 01:32:17,100\nif you know the more you risk the more\n\n2266\n01:32:14,460 --> 01:32:20,100\nyou potentially lose but all also the\n\n2267\n01:32:17,100 --> 01:32:23,820\nmore you potentially gain when you share\n\n2268\n01:32:20,100 --> 01:32:26,699\nyour share your heart with somebody they\n\n2269\n01:32:23,820 -->

01:32:35,880\nperformers particularly musicians they\n\n2273\n01:32:33,480 --> 01:32:38,040\nput up this wall there's this wall of\n\n2274\n01:32:35,880 --> 01:32:40,679\nimage and you know what they're\n\n2275\n01:32:38,040 --> 01:32:43,980\nprojecting and you get this rock and\n\n2276\n01:32:40,679 --> 01:32:46,620\nroll show you get this Superstar and\n\n2277\n01:32:43,980 --> 01:32:48,300\nthen you're the audience and there's not\n\n2278\n01:32:46,620 --> 01:32:49,080\nthe connection is only that you love\n\n2279\n01:32:48,300 --> 01:32:51,960\nthem\n\n2280\n01:32:49,080

are\n\n2299\n01:33:34,920 --> 01:33:40,080\nteetering on the edge of an Annihilation\n\n2300\n01:33:37,159 --> 01:33:42,600\nand there and they they've arrived at a\n\n2301\n01:33:40,080 --> 01:33:45,300\npoint in the show then where they go\n\n2302\n01:33:42,600 --> 01:33:47,699\nand then but they also go\n\n2303\n01:33:45,300 --> 01:33:49,440\nlet's listen to what he has to say

they want to\n\n2309\n01:34:00,360 --> 01:34:04,560\nshow me that they understand and that\n\n2310\n01:34:02,340 --> 01:34:06,480\nthey care and they stand up and that\n\n2311\n01:34:04,560 --> 01:34:08,159\nwhen when everybody's being blown to\n\n2312\n01:34:06,480 --> 01:34:09,840\nbits and it's the end of the world in\n\n2313\n01:34:08,159 --> 01:34:12,000\nthe song and we\n\n2314\n01:34:09,840 --> 01:34:15,600\nit's visual as well it's beautiful\n\n2315\n01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:18,480\nanimation that Sean Evans has made who's\n\n2316\n01:34:15,600 --> 01:34:21,480\nmy collaborator in all things visually\n\n2317\n01:34:18,480 --> 01:34:24,000\nin these shows and and the people sort\n\n2318\n01:34:21,480 --> 01:34:26,100\nof get it but it still is it's pretty\n\n2319\n01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:30,300\nsomber because there's there's nothing\n\n2320\n01:34:26,100 --> 01:34:32,460\nreally Rara or rock and roll about\n\n2321\n01:34:30,300 --> 01:34:35,699\nnuclear war\n\n2322\n01:34:32,460 --> 01:34:37,860\nnothing but you can't ignore it and when\n\n2323\n01:34:35,699 --> 01:34:39,900\nI say you know if you run into Joe Biden\n\n2324\n01:34:37,860 --> 01:34:42,000\nin the street you might just tap him on\n\n2325\n01:34:39,900 --> 01:34:44,179\nthe shoulder say Hey Joe\n\n2326\n01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:47,400\nshouldn't we get rid of nuclear weapons\n\n2327\n01:34:44,179 --> 01:34:50,219\nyou know why not spend our time let's\n\n2328\n01:34:47,400 --> 01:34:52,500\ntalk to Putin about that and also Joanna\n\n2329\n01:34:50,219 --> 01:34:54,239\nthat all the nuclear Partners let why\n\n2330\n01:34:52,500 --> 01:34:56,820\ndon't we all get together and say listen\n\n2331\n01:34:54,239 --> 01:34:58,860\nthese are too dangerous\n\n2332\n01:34:56,820 --> 01:35:02,280\ncan we all agree now we've had them\n\n2333\n01:34:58,860 --> 01:35:04,800\nsince 1945 and they've done nobody any\n\n2334\n01:35:02,280 --> 01:35:06,060\ngood can't we just get rid of them so we\n\n2335\n01:35:04,800 --> 01:35:08,280\ndon't have to worry about them anymore\n\n2336\n01:35:06,060 --> 01:35:10,139\nthe problem is they would worry that\n\n2337\n01:35:08,280 --> 01:35:12,120\nsomeone wouldn't\n\n2338\n01:35:10,139 --> 01:35:14,159\nand that person would have the nuclear\n\n2339\n01:35:12,120 --> 01:35:17,219\nadvancement well somebody maybe wouldn't\n\n2340\n01:35:14,159 --> 01:35:19,679\nwhile we've got them part of the worry\n\n2341\n01:35:17,219 --> 01:35:22,260\nabout the big accident is them falling\n\n2342\n01:35:19,679 --> 01:35:24,960\ninto wrong hands yes you know and that's\n\n2343\n01:35:22,260 --> 01:35:27,179\na perfectly legitimate concern in my\n\n2344\n01:35:24,960 --> 01:35:28,860\nview it is could you do is it possible\n\n2345\n01:35:27,179 --> 01:35:31,020\ndo you think to put that Genie back into\n\n2346\n01:35:28,860 --> 01:35:32,940\nthe bottle though yeah of course it can\n\n2347\n01:35:31,020 --> 01:35:34,980\nbe done yeah I think so yeah all it\n\n2348\n01:35:32,940 --> 01:35:37,199\nrequires is the will the will of the\n\n2349\n01:35:34,980 --> 01:35:39,060\npeople to persuade but again it's like\n\n2350\n01:35:37,199 --> 01:35:42,420\nyou you can't do it until you can\n\n2351\n01:35:39,060 --> 01:35:44,699\nseparate until you get rid of citizens\n\n2352\n01:35:42,420 --> 01:35:46,980\nunited you can't do it until you take\n\n2353\n01:35:44,699 --> 01:35:48,900\nmoney out of politics right you\n\n2354\n01:35:46,980 --> 01:35:50,580\ncertainly can't do it over here in the\n\n2355\n01:35:48,900 --> 01:35:52,460\nUnited States whether they could do it\n\n2356\n01:35:50,580 --> 01:35:55,620\nin Russia or you know Russia's\n\n2357\n01:35:52,460 --> 01:35:58,020\nautocratic state so who knew when people\n\n2358\n01:35:55,620 --> 01:36:00,960\nbring up not yeah Russia and or China\n\n2359\n01:35:58,020 --> 01:36:03,360\nwith me you know I say you're too into\n\n2360\n01:36:00,960 --> 01:36:05,219\nthe wrong bloke I don't speak Russian I\n\n2361\n01:36:03,360 --> 01:36:07,139\ndon't speak Chinese I've never lived\n\n2362\n01:36:05,219 --> 01:36:08,520\nthere I know a little bit about the\n\n2363\n01:36:07,139 --> 01:36:11,100\nUnited States and about the United\n\n2364\n01:36:08,520 --> 01:36:13,800\nKingdom and less but a little bit about\n\n2365\n01:36:11,100 --> 01:36:16,080\nI speak Greek so I know a bit about\n\n2366\n01:36:13,800 --> 01:36:17,760\nGreece and and you know we learned\n\n2367\n01:36:16,080 --> 01:36:20,460\nFrench when I was at school and there\n\n2368\n01:36:17,760 --> 01:36:23,820\nare neighbors who we hate across across\n\n2369\n01:36:20,460 --> 01:36:26,400\nlamosh but I can't without speaking\n\n2370\n01:36:23,820 --> 01:36:28,320\nRussian and Mandarin how can you\n\n2371\n01:36:26,400 --> 01:36:30,420\npossibly know what's right what's going\n\n2372\n01:36:28,320 --> 01:36:32,520\non and also how could you know in the\n\n2373\n01:36:30,420 --> 01:36:34,320\ncontext of their culture like you don't\n\n2374\n01:36:32,520 --> 01:36:36,900\ntotally understand their culture unless\n\n2375\n01:36:34,320 --> 01:36:39,560\nyou speak their language exactly that's\n\n2376\n01:36:36,900 --> 01:36:42,300\nexactly right language is so important\n\n2377\n01:36:39,560 --> 01:36:45,719\nthat's why it's no surprise that Chomsky\n\n2378\n01:36:42,300 --> 01:36:47,699\nyou know is is his work in linguistics\n\n2379\n01:36:45,719 --> 01:36:50,340\nwas the thing that brought him to notice\n\n2380\n01:36:47,699 --> 01:36:52,920\nof other academics and intellectuals\n\n2381\n01:36:50,340 --> 01:36:56,219\nback in the 50s but and he's right\n\n2382\n01:36:52,920 --> 01:36:59,340\nbecause you know linguish has always\n\n2383\n01:36:56,219 --> 01:37:00,900\nbeen hugely important if

01:39:23,520\nwas working I changed smoke literally so\n\n2441\n01:39:21,480 --> 01:39:26,580\nI would smoke three packs at least a day\n\n2442\n01:39:23,520 --> 01:39:28,260\nwow of Marlboro Reds and I gave up\n\n2443\n01:39:26,580 --> 01:39:32,159\neventually\n\n2444\n01:39:28,260 --> 01:39:34,679\nand and I gave up like in the late 60s\n\n2445\n01:39:32,159 --> 01:39:38,400\nbut I didn't really give up I gave up\n\n2446\n01:39:34,679 --> 01:39:40,500\nsmoking rolled cigarettes I continued to\n\n2447\n01:39:38,400 --> 01:39:43,739\nsmoke cigarettes with tobacco and\n\n2448\n01:39:40,500 -->

big thing\n\n2451\n01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:53,460\nin England spliffs spliffs yeah when I\n\n2452\n01:39:51,360 --> 01:39:54,600\nwas over there I was fascinated by that\n\n2453\n01:39:53,460 -->

did\n\n2456\n01:39:59,940 --> 01:40:05,940\nit because I was addicted to nicotine\n\n2457\n01:40:01,980 --> 01:40:08,280\nand then in 1975 I realized that that's\n\n2458\n01:40:05,940 --> 01:40:10,260\nwhat I was doing uh and after that I\n\n2459\n01:40:08,280 --> 01:40:12,360\nnever smoked dope again I didn't like it\n\n2460\n01:40:10,260 --> 01:40:14,580\nI don't like being stoned I don't like\n\n2461\n01:40:12,360 --> 01:40:16,440\nthe feeling it makes me paranoid that's\n\n2462\n01:40:14,580 --> 01:40:18,139\nwhat I like about it\n\n2463\n01:40:16,440 --> 01:40:22,560\nforeign\n\n2464\n01:40:18,139 --> 01:40:27,320\nyeah I like it oh my God I enjoyed the\n\n2465\n01:40:22,560 --> 01:40:27,320\nfeeling of vulnerability sometimes wow\n\n2466\n01:40:27,739 --> 01:40:32,600\nis the French of it\n\n2467\n01:40:30,360 --> 01:40:35,340\nI don't like it\n\n2468\n01:40:32,600 --> 01:40:38,639\nI'm paranoid enough already without\n\n2469\n01:40:35,340 --> 01:40:42,540\nsmoking oh I am too but uh occasionally\n\n2470\n01:40:38,639 --> 01:40:46,199\nI think um just the there's\n\n2471\n01:40:42,540 --> 01:40:49,739\nan understanding of vulnerability that\n\n2472\n01:40:46,199 --> 01:40:52,199\ncomes through marijuana that I enjoy\n\n2473\n01:40:49,739 --> 01:40:53,940\nit's sort of a perspective enhancer for\n\n2474\n01:40:52,199 --> 01:40:57,120\nme sometimes okay\n\n2475\n01:40:53,940 --> 01:40:58,380\nwell good for you but you know with dark\n\n2476\n01:40:57,120 --> 01:41:00,900\nside of the moon\n\n2477\n01:40:58,380 --> 01:41:02,340\nand with the Wizard of Oz the\n\n2478\n01:41:00,900 --> 01:41:04,340\ncombination\n\n2479\n01:41:02,340 --> 01:41:07,440\npretty incredible all right because\n\n2480\n01:41:04,340 --> 01:41:10,679\nwe've got that out in life\n\n2481\n01:41:07,440 --> 01:41:15,000\nso when you guys like in the early days\n\n2482\n01:41:10,679 --> 01:41:17,040\nof the band what was uh like that's\n\n2483\n01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:19,560\nalways the connection with rock and roll\n\n2484\n01:41:17,040 --> 01:41:21,840\nand drugs like this is like that's the\n\n2485\n01:41:19,560 --> 01:41:25,260\nnarrative yeah was that in the early\n\n2486\n01:41:21,840 --> 01:41:28,199\ndays of Pink Floyd was that the case it\n\n2487\n01:41:25,260 --> 01:41:30,600\nwasn't really no relevant I mean during\n\n2488\n01:41:28,199 --> 01:41:35,820\nthe the time when I was smoking hash\n\n2489\n01:41:30,600 --> 01:41:38,040\nevery day was 1970 71 70. so it's pretty\n\n2490\n01:41:35,820 --> 01:41:40,320\npretty dark side is when we were making\n\n2491\n01:41:38,040 --> 01:41:42,360\nMetals so it's Echoes and things but I\n\n2492\n01:41:40,320 --> 01:41:46,800\ndon't I don't think it had I don't think\n\n2493\n01:41:42,360 --> 01:41:48,960\nit impinged on my burgeoning writing\n\n2494\n01:41:46,800 --> 01:41:53,400\ncareer if you like when I was you know\n\n2495\n01:41:48,960 --> 01:41:53,400\nstarting to write songs because Sid\n\n2496\n01:41:53,820 --> 01:41:59,159\num went crazy in nineteen\n\n2497\n01:41:57,560 --> 01:42:00,739\n67.\n\n2498\n01:41:59,159 --> 01:42:03,300\nand so by\n\n2499\n01:42:00,739 --> 01:42:06,000\n690 wasn't we weren't seeing him anymore\n\n2500\n01:42:03,300 --> 01:42:08,780\nhe disappeared completely and was that\n\n2501\n01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:11,520\nbecause of LSD\n\n2502\n01:42:08,780 --> 01:42:13,020\nno I don't think so but you know that's\n\n2503\n01:42:11,520 --> 01:42:16,139\nthe narrative right yeah that's the\n\n2504\n01:42:13,020 --> 01:42:16,800\nnarrative or one of the narratives\n\n2505\n01:42:16,139 --> 01:42:20,280\num\n\n2506\n01:42:16,800 --> 01:42:22,139\nit may be because he he was mixing with\n\n2507\n01:42:20,280 --> 01:42:26,340\npeople who were doing acid on a regular\n\n2508\n01:42:22,139 --> 01:42:27,900\nbasis I think in 67\n\n2509\n01:42:26,340 --> 01:42:28,980\num\n\n2510\n01:42:27,900 --> 01:42:31,260\nand and\n\n2511\n01:42:28,980 --> 01:42:33,480\num I'm sure he did too much he did too\n\n2512\n01:42:31,260 --> 01:42:35,760\nmuch of it was he teetering on the edge\n\n2513\n01:42:33,480 --> 01:42:38,820\nof what might be called schizophrenia at\n\n2514\n01:42:35,760 --> 01:42:41,040\nthe time I think so probably\n\n2515\n01:42:38,820 --> 01:42:43,380\na lot of the things that he was saying\n\n2516\n01:42:41,040 --> 01:42:46,739\nand it was right at the beginning of us\n\n2517\n01:42:43,380 --> 01:42:49,380\ngetting our first record in any chart\n\n2518\n01:42:46,739 --> 01:42:51,780\nwhich was Arnold Lane now it was after\n\n2519\n01:42:49,380 --> 01:42:54,179\nonline it was in when see Emily play\n\n2520\n01:42:51,780 --> 01:42:57,960\ncame out and we were beginning to do TV\n\n2521\n01:42:54,179 --> 01:43:01,380\nshows in England and and I he went very\n\n2522\n01:42:57,960 --> 01:43:04,920\nodd and he started I remember him at top\n\n2523\n01:43:01,380 --> 01:43:06,900\nof the pops in the dressing room one day\n\n2524\n01:43:04,920 --> 01:43:09,840\num he had hair a bit like that painting\n\n2525\n01:43:06,900 --> 01:43:11,280\non the wall and uh going sort of like\n\n2526\n01:43:09,840 --> 01:43:14,699\nand then going\n\n2527\n01:43:11,280 --> 01:43:16,560\nlooking worried and a bit frightened and\n\n2528\n01:43:14,699 --> 01:43:19,500\nthen going\n\n2529\n01:43:16,560 --> 01:43:22,619\nJohn Lennon doesn't have to do this\n\n2530\n01:43:19,500 --> 01:43:24,480\nyou know which was kind of wacky\n\n2531\n01:43:22,619 --> 01:43:26,580\num\n\n2532\n01:43:24,480 --> 01:43:28,260\nthis was like three quarters of the way\n\n2533\n01:43:26,580 --> 01:43:31,739\nthrough the Beatles career because\n\n2534\n01:43:28,260 --> 01:43:36,119\nthey'd only had that one decade really\n\n2535\n01:43:31,739 --> 01:43:38,760\num and so he he had misgivings about\n\n2536\n01:43:36,119 --> 01:43:40,860\nbeing on a miming pop show you know and\n\n2537\n01:43:38,760 --> 01:43:42,960\nwe said this is what we've worked\n\n2538\n01:43:40,860 --> 01:43:45,900\ntowards for the last four or five years\n\n2539\n01:43:42,960 --> 01:43:48,780\nis to be on top of the pups and make a\n\n2540\n01:43:45,900 --> 01:43:50,159\nfew quid you know buck up boy let's get\n\n2541\n01:43:48,780 --> 01:43:53,400\non with it\n\n2542\n01:43:50,159 --> 01:43:56,880\nand uh but he never did back up from\n\n2543\n01:43:53,400 --> 01:43:59,699\nfrom sort of that moment on really he\n\n2544\n01:43:56,880 --> 01:44:03,360\nwrote a few more songs but nothing of\n\n2545\n01:43:59,699 --> 01:44:06,360\nany any real note and he just got more\n\n2546\n01:44:03,360 --> 01:44:08,460\nand more and more detached until he was\n\n2547\n01:44:06,360 --> 01:44:12,719\ncompletely wacky and not making any\n\n2548\n01:44:08,460 --> 01:44:15,179\nsense and we may I mean I made a lot of\n\n2549\n01:44:12,719 --> 01:44:17,940\num attempts to find out what was wrong\n\n2550\n01:44:15,179 --> 01:44:19,560\nand to involve his family you know he\n\n2551\n01:44:17,940 --> 01:44:20,820\nhad Elder brothers so I would ring up\n\n2552\n01:44:19,560 --> 01:44:23,520\nand say hey there's something really\n\n2553\n01:44:20,820 --> 01:44:25,739\nwrong with Roger as they called

attaches\n\n2655\n01:48:30,600 --> 01:48:36,540\nboth to the melody and and to the\n\n2656\n01:48:34,320 --> 01:48:37,320\num time signature and the tempo of the\n\n2657\n01:48:36,540 -->

to allow a bit\n\n3034\n02:03:53,280 --> 02:03:57,840\nmore leeway particularly say in Latin\n\n3035\n02:03:55,440 --> 02:04:00,719\nAmerica took the new Colombian\n\n3036\n02:03:57,840 -->

know\n\n3045\n02:04:18,719 --> 02:04:25,440\nso it it's hard to know because we the\n\n3046\n02:04:22,260 --> 02:04:28,380\nWest the UK and the United States and\n\n3047\n02:04:25,440 -->

the country\n\n3055\n02:04:47,880 --> 02:04:53,880\nisn't it almost ironic that the one\n\n3056\n02:04:51,119 --> 02:04:56,340\ncountry that was founded within the last\n\n3057\n02:04:53,880 --> 02:04:59,460\nfew hundred years to escape from the\n\n3058\n02:04:56,340 --> 02:05:01,980\ncontrol of a dictatorship became the\n\n3059\n02:04:59,460 --> 02:05:05,280\ncountry that intervenes in more\n\n3060\n02:05:01,980 --> 02:05:06,900\ncountries government than any yeah it's\n\n3061\n02:05:05,280 --> 02:05:09,080\npretty wild if you really think about\n\n3062\n02:05:06,900 --> 02:05:12,060\nthe origins of the United States yeah\n\n3063\n02:05:09,080 --> 02:05:14,639\nbut what's what's what's really what's\n\n3064\n02:05:12,060 --> 02:05:17,040\nreally interesting is yes it is very\n\n3065\n02:05:14,639 --> 02:05:18,960\nvery interesting it's fascinating but if\n\n3066\n02:05:17,040 --> 02:05:20,400\nyou've read the Constitution you've\n\n3067\n02:05:18,960 --> 02:05:22,080\nprobably read your Constitution more\n\n3068\n02:05:20,400 --> 02:05:23,520\ncarefully than I had in the Bill of\n\n3069\n02:05:22,080 --> 02:05:25,619\nRights and the whatever\n\n3070\n02:05:23,520 --> 02:05:28,380\nand the way the Electoral College was\n\n3071\n02:05:25,619 --> 02:05:31,500\nset up it was sort of set up so that the\n\n3072\n02:05:28,380 --> 02:05:33,659\npeople never really have a chance to\n\n3073\n02:05:31,500 --> 02:05:36,119\nhave any power in it it's set up to be\n\n3074\n02:05:33,659 --> 02:05:37,980\nruled by the elite who created and wrote\n\n3075\n02:05:36,119 --> 02:05:39,659\nthe Constitution but what I was going to\n\n3076\n02:05:37,980 --> 02:05:42,719\nsay was\n\n3077\n02:05:39,659 --> 02:05:45,900\num what was I going to say isn't it yeah\n\n3078\n02:05:42,719 --> 02:05:48,840\nbut it's interesting as well that\n\n3079\n02:05:45,900 --> 02:05:50,760\nthe media is so powerful and it's so\n\n3080\n02:05:48,840 --> 02:05:53,699\nsewn up and says the same thing in\n\n3081\n02:05:50,760 --> 02:05:56,639\ncontext Democrats and Republicans all of\n\n3082\n02:05:53,699 --> 02:06:00,480\nit together which is no we're the good\n\n3083\n02:05:56,639 --> 02:06:02,880\nguys yeah and somehow it gets ignored\n\n3084\n02:06:00,480 --> 02:06:05,159\nthe the United States of America has\n\n3085\n02:06:02,880 --> 02:06:07,320\ninterfered in more elections and they've\n\n3086\n02:06:05,159 --> 02:06:09,480\nbeen involved in more coups and invaded\n\n3087\n02:06:07,320 --> 02:06:12,599\nmore countries and

02:28:54,540\nof the Palestinians yeah then you are\n\n3625\n02:28:52,500 --> 02:28:56,460\nconnected to Hamas and then all sudden\n\n3626\n02:28:54,540 --> 02:28:58,740\nyou're connected to this terrorist\n\n3627\n02:28:56,460 --> 02:29:02,220\norganization and it doesn't matter about\n\n3628\n02:28:58,740 --> 02:29:04,439\nthose people yeah the The Narrative is\n\n3629\n02:29:02,220 --> 02:29:07,920\nsupportive Israel equals you're on the\n\n3630\n02:29:04,439 --> 02:29:10,500\nright side yeah yeah regardless of how\n\n3631\n02:29:07,920 --> 02:29:12,479\ntheir policies impact individual human\n\n3632\n02:29:10,500 --> 02:29:15,300\nbeings through no fault of their own\n\n3633\n02:29:12,479 --> 02:29:19,140\njust happen to be born Palestinian and\n\n3634\n02:29:15,300 --> 02:29:22,200\nbeen stuck in this apartheid state and\n\n3635\n02:29:19,140 --> 02:29:24,780\nthat's the other thing is that they you\n\n3636\n02:29:22,200 --> 02:29:26,520\nknow it's it's very binary in that way\n\n3637\n02:29:24,780 --> 02:29:28,859\nit's like you're either with Israel or\n\n3638\n02:29:26,520 --> 02:29:31,020\nyou're with Hamas you're with this\n\n3639\n02:29:28,859 --> 02:29:33,240\nterrorist organization that puts its\n\n3640\n02:29:31,020 --> 02:29:35,399\npeople in danger purposely and uses them\n\n3641\n02:29:33,240 --> 02:29:37,979\nas cannon fodder so they can gain\n\n3642\n02:29:35,399 --> 02:29:40,439\nsupport internationally and and does all\n\n3643\n02:29:37,979 --> 02:29:43,020\nthese human rights atrocities and\n\n3644\n02:29:40,439 --> 02:29:46,560\nlaunches missiles at Israel\n\n3645\n02:29:43,020 --> 02:29:48,120\nwell yeah I know I I hear all of this\n\n3646\n02:29:46,560 --> 02:29:50,460\njust the same as you do but they're just\n\n3647\n02:29:48,120 --> 02:29:52,620\nhumans well they're also the\n\n3648\n02:29:50,460 --> 02:29:56,520\ndemocratically elected government of\n\n3649\n02:29:52,620 --> 02:29:59,100\nGaza Hamas okay and there is an armed\n\n3650\n02:29:56,520 --> 02:30:01,319\nwing and whatever but if you actually\n\n3651\n02:29:59,100 --> 02:30:04,020\nread international law at all or the\n\n3652\n02:30:01,319 --> 02:30:07,200\nGeneva conventions and occupied people\n\n3653\n02:30:04,020 --> 02:30:09,840\nhave an absolute legal and moral right\n\n3654\n02:30:07,200 --> 02:30:11,880\nto resist the occupation\n\n3655\n02:30:09,840 --> 02:30:15,180\nand this is this is the fact that it's\n\n3656\n02:30:11,880 --> 02:30:17,460\nnot banded about when they talk about\n\n3657\n02:30:15,180 --> 02:30:19,439\num firing Rockets into Israel which\n\n3658\n02:30:17,460 --> 02:30:22,500\nalmost never do any damage because\n\n3659\n02:30:19,439 --> 02:30:25,200\nthey're very ineffectual but it it's\n\n3660\n02:30:22,500 --> 02:30:28,500\nand and then another thing that is a\n\n3661\n02:30:25,200 --> 02:30:30,060\ngreat worry to the Palestinian Community\n\n3662\n02:30:28,500 --> 02:30:32,399\nis that\n\n3663\n02:30:30,060 --> 02:30:35,460\nthe Israelis seem now to have a policy\n\n3664\n02:30:32,399 --> 02:30:38,160\nof pushing them murdering so many of\n\n3665\n02:30:35,460 --> 02:30:41,700\nthem that they are absolutely trying to\n\n3666\n02:30:38,160 --> 02:30:44,040\ncreate another interviewer so they can\n\n3667\n02:30:41,700 --> 02:30:46,920\nmake it an armed conflict where they're\n\n3668\n02:30:44,040 --> 02:30:48,780\na thousand times of ten thousand times\n\n3669\n02:30:46,920 --> 02:30:51,120\nmore powerful\n\n3670\n02:30:48,780 --> 02:30:53,399\nthan the Palestinian people who are they\n\n3671\n02:30:51,120 --> 02:30:55,380\nare hoping will arm themselves and young\n\n3672\n02:30:53,399 --> 02:30:58,080\npeople gather together in bounds and try\n\n3673\n02:30:55,380 --> 02:30:59,760\nand have an Insurrection and armed\n\n3674\n02:30:58,080 --> 02:31:01,380\nintercept so they can just kill them all\n\n3675\n02:30:59,760 --> 02:31:03,540\nwhen you see that Hamas is the\n\n3676\n02:31:01,380 --> 02:31:06,300\ndemocratically elected leaders of\n\n3677\n02:31:03,540 --> 02:31:08,640\nPalestine how could they say Palestine\n\n3678\n02:31:06,300 --> 02:31:12,780\ninstead of Gaza excuse me of Gaza yeah\n\n3679\n02:31:08,640 --> 02:31:15,600\nhow corrupt is that election\n\n3680\n02:31:12,780 --> 02:31:19,260\nI have no idea I wasn't there but it was\n\n3681\n02:31:15,600 --> 02:31:20,880\nin 2011 I think it was the uh has there\n\n3682\n02:31:19,260 --> 02:31:23,520\nbeen an election since then I don't know\n\n3683\n02:31:20,880 --> 02:31:26,760\nhow you would organize anything in Gaza\n\n3684\n02:31:23,520 --> 02:31:28,680\nwhich is a prison right it's got borders\n\n3685\n02:31:26,760 --> 02:31:30,840\nthe Israelis control who comes in and\n\n3686\n02:31:28,680 --> 02:31:33,000\ngoes out they open far and go on\n\n3687\n02:31:30,840 --> 02:31:36,359\nPalestinian fishing boats again\n\n3688\n02:31:33,000 --> 02:31:39,120\nyesterday so I I can't really answer\n\n3689\n02:31:36,359 --> 02:31:41,939\nthat question because I'm not there and\n\n3690\n02:31:39,120 --> 02:31:44,280\nand I don't know does anybody have a\n\n3691\n02:31:41,939 --> 02:31:46,380\nclear path of resolution that makes\n\n3692\n02:31:44,280 --> 02:31:48,540\nsense for that area where they could sit\n\n3693\n02:31:46,380 --> 02:31:52,380\ndown and come up with some sort of\n\n3694\n02:31:48,540 --> 02:31:54,960\nHumane logical compassionate way\n\n3695\n02:31:52,380 --> 02:31:57,600\nto mitigate some of these problems\n\n3696\n02:31:54,960 --> 02:31:58,859\ndoes anyone yeah I do what is your you\n\n3697\n02:31:57,600 --> 02:32:01,020\ndo\n\n3698\n02:31:58,859 --> 02:32:03,479\nyou you give equal human rights to\n\n3699\n02:32:01,020 --> 02:32:05,819\npeople and but you would have to stop\n\n3700\n02:32:03,479 --> 02:32:07,979\nthe occupation and stop one group of\n\n3701\n02:32:05,819 --> 02:32:09,899\npeople oppressing another group of\n\n3702\n02:32:07,979 --> 02:32:11,819\npeople you would have to accept the\n\n3703\n02:32:09,899 --> 02:32:16,260\nprinciples\n\n3704\n02:32:11,819 --> 02:32:18,899\nof Paris 1948 and everything would\n\n3705\n02:32:16,260 --> 02:32:21,060\ndevelop from that then you could have a\n\n3706\n02:32:18,899 --> 02:32:22,920\nprocess you could all get on a plane and\n\n3707\n02:32:21,060 --> 02:32:25,319\ngo to Oslo and have meetings they did\n\n3708\n02:32:22,920 --> 02:32:28,260\nthat once before but nobody stood by\n\n3709\n02:32:25,319 --> 02:32:31,979\nanything that was agreed in Oslo it was\n\n3710\n02:32:28,260 -->

02:43:10,620\nvery disturbing thing but the most\n\n3955\n02:43:07,500 --> 02:43:14,340\ndisturbing thing is that there's no list\n\n3956\n02:43:10,620 --> 02:43:17,399\nlike this is that that's a real crime\n\n3957\n02:43:14,340 --> 02:43:22,260\nright well isn't the story The anecdotal\n\n3958\n02:43:17,399 --> 02:43:23,700\nthe anecdote is isn't isn't it the\n\n3959\n02:43:22,260 -->

02:43:34,319\nand to get off the list\n\n3963\n02:43:31,460 --> 02:43:36,060\nsupposedly it's hard to know whether or\n\n3964\n02:43:34,319 --> 02:43:37,859\nnot that's true but for sure there's\n\n3965\n02:43:36,060 --> 02:43:39,359\nMoney's been exchanged influence has\n\n3966\n02:43:37,859 --> 02:43:41,460\nbeen exchanged something people are just\n\n3967\n02:43:39,359 --> 02:43:43,800\nthey're not throwing any bones right\n\n3968\n02:43:41,460 --> 02:43:45,479\nlike there has to be a large group of\n\n3969\n02:43:43,800 --> 02:43:47,939\npeople that were involved in this and\n\n3970\n02:43:45,479 --> 02:43:50,280\nthere's none that are being exposed\n\n3971\n02:43:47,939 --> 02:43:52,979\nwhich is quite fascinating because I\n\n3972\n02:43:50,280 -->

but Bill Gates after Jeffrey\n\n3983\n02:44:14,700 --> 02:44:22,020\nEpstein had been arrested and convicted\n\n3984\n02:44:18,479 --> 02:44:24,899\nfor statutory rape right I mean he

00:07:30,180\r\neran todos israelíes porque los palestinos\r\n\r\n178\r\n00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:33,060\r\nNo se les permite viajar, por lo que hay\r\n\r\n179\r\n00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:35,220\r\nNo podía haber ningún palestino allí\r\n\r\n180\r\n00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:37,380\r\nNecesitaría un permiso especial, ¿sabes?\r\n\r\n181\r\n00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:39,360\r\nPor supuesto, para cruzar los puestos de control.\r\n\r\n182\r\n00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:41,940\r\ny cosas que no conseguirían, así que nosotros\r\n\r\n183\r\n00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:44,460\r\nHice este concierto y\r\n\r\n184\r\n00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:46,440\r\nAl final y fue encantador que\r\n\r\n185\r\n00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:48,240\r\nEstaban extremadamente entusiasmados porque sabían\r\n\r\n186\r\n00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:51,800\r\nel trabajo muy bien\r\n\r\n187\r\n00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,800\r\ny eso fue muy uh\r\n\r\n188\r\n00:07:52,979 --> 00:07:57,300\r\nY todo eso y comida deliciosa.\r\n\r\n189\r\n00:07:55,380 --> 00:08:00,780\r\nEntre bastidores y era un verano cálido.\r\n\r\n190\r\n00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:02,699\r\nPor la noche, al final, pensé que estaba...\r\n\r\n191\r\n00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:05,759\r\nVoy a decir algo, oh, fue eufórico.\r\n\r\n192\r\n00:08:02,699 --> 00:08:07,620\r\nAl final del concierto y lo dije.\r\n\r\n193\r\n00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:10,319\r\nHizo un pequeño discurso y me fui.\r\n\r\n194\r\n00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:13,080\r\nUstedes son la generación de jóvenes israelíes.\r\n\r\n195\r\n00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:15,180\r\nque necesitan hacer las paces con su\r\n\r\n196\r\n00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:17,220\r\nLos vecinos empiezan a hablar con el\r\n\r\n197\r\n00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:20,340\r\nAutoridad Palestina y el bla bla

00:08:26,639\r\nnada\r\n\r\n201\r\n00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:30,539\r\nFue como si las persianas de acero se hubieran caído.\r\n\r\n202\r\n00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:33,539\r\nDetrás de los ojos de cada uno de nosotros\r\n\r\n203\r\n00:08:30,539 --> 00:08:35,820\r\nesos sesenta mil jóvenes\r\n\r\n204\r\n00:08:33,539 --> 00:08:38,219\r\nse habían ido\r\n\r\n205\r\n00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:40,140\r\ny me quedé atónito\r\n\r\n206\r\n00:08:38,219 --> 00:08:43,260\r\npor eso\r\n\r\n207\r\n00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:45,959\r\nY yo estaba realmente sorprendido, realmente, realmente.\r\n\r\n208\r\n00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:48,660\r\nRealmente me sorprendí, no lo podía creer y\r\n\r\n209\r\n00:08:45,959 --> 00:08:50,580\r\nLo vi, volví al año siguiente y\r\n\r\n210\r\n00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:52,440\r\nviajó extensamente por los territorios ocupados\r\n\r\n211\r\n00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:54,860\r\nterritorios hasta que llegues allí y tú\r\n\r\n212\r\n00:08:52,440 -->

sabrías\r\n\r\n215\r\n00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:03,480\r\ncreer posible en cualquier parte del mundo\r\n\r\n216\r\n00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:05,399\r\ncomo caminos diferentes para las personas con\r\n\r\n217\r\n00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:07,920\r\n¿Qué religión diferente te imaginas?\r\n\r\n218\r\n00:09:05,399 --> 00:09:11,580\r\n¿De verdad sí? ¿De verdad te lo puedes

carretera\r\n\r\n224\r\n00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:25,019\r\nAsí que si eres ateo o algo así\r\n\r\n225\r\n00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:26,820\r\nOtra cosa que no te está permitido conducir\r\n\r\n226\r\n00:09:25,019 --> 00:09:29,160\r\nEn la carretera hay que ir por caminos secundarios\r\n\r\n227\r\n00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:30,899\r\nY solo ellos y están todos llenos\r\n\r\n228\r\n00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:32,640\r\ncon Boulders y hay puestos de control\r\n\r\n229\r\n00:09:30,899 --> 00:09:36,060\r\nEn todas partes, los indígenas locales\r\n\r\n230\r\n00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:37,980\r\nA la gente no se le permite utilizar las carreteras\r\n\r\n231\r\n00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:39,120\r\ny eso lo ves y eso cuando

mientras conduces y todo\r\n\r\n235\r\n00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:48,660\r\nLos puestos de control y ellos tienen que ir\r\n\r\n236\r\n00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:50,519\r\nPor aquí solo personas con carnet amarillo\r\n\r\n237\r\n00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:52,920\r\nLas placas pueden pasar por aquí, lo que significa\r\n\r\n238\r\n00:09:50,519 --> 00:09:55,519\r\nque son judíos israelíes\r\n\r\n239\r\n00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:55,519\r\ny es\r\n\r\n240\r\n00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:58,680\r\naturdidoramente\r\n\r\n241\r\n00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:03,300\r\num te llena de desesperación cuando ves\r\n\r\n242\r\n00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:05,959\r\n¿Te preguntas cómo es posible que esto sea posible?\r\n\r\n243\r\n00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:09,480\r\nEstá pasando, sabes que esto es así.\r\n\r\n244\r\n00:10:05,959 --> 00:10:11,519\r\n2007 o cuando sea ¿cómo puede ser esto?\r\n\r\n245\r\n00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:13,860\r\nsucediendo en el mundo\r\n\r\n246\r\n00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:16,080\r\nY nadie donde vivo lo sabe\r\n\r\n247\r\n00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:19,500\r\no si lo hacen no les importa cómo pueden\r\n\r\n248\r\n00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:22,320\r\nA ellos no les importa y yo digo que podrías traer\r\n\r\n249\r\n00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:23,760\r\nPóngalo aquí y diga cómo se sentiría si\r\n\r\n250\r\n00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:26,040\r\nNo eras cristiano y eso significaba\r\n\r\n251\r\n00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:28,740\r\nNo pudiste usar la carretera\r\n\r\n252\r\n00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:31,560\r\nQuiero decir que es tan raro que es difícil...\r\n\r\n253\r\n00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:34,140\r\nQuita tu mente de la cabeza la creencia de que eso\r\n\r\n254\r\n00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:36,959\r\nes el caso pero lo es y eso es lo que\r\n\r\n255\r\n00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:39,180\r\nse llama apartheid\r\n\r\n256\r\n00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:41,459\r\nY en aquellos días no se podía usar el\r\n\r\n257\r\n00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:46,019\r\nLa palabra apartheid en relación con Israel es\r\n\r\n258\r\n00:10:41,459 --> 00:10:47,880\r\nfue completamente prohibido en 2006.\r\n\r\n259\r\n00:10:46,019 --> 00:10:50,100\r\nNo podrías usar la palabra que hubieras usado\r\n\r\n260\r\n00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:52,740\r\nha sido colgado en la prensa y\r\n\r\n261\r\n00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:54,779\r\nen todas partes y acusado de ser un\r\n\r\n262\r\n00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:57,720\r\nHolocausto en hierro o esto y aquello y\r\n\r\n263\r\n00:10:54,779 --> 00:11:01,019\r\nHitler y lo que sea ahora\r\n\r\n264\r\n00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:03,540\r\nEs muy difícil para cualquiera tener una\r\n\r\n265\r\n00:11:01,019 --> 00:11:06,899\r\nconversación sobre Israel y Palestina\r\n\r\n266\r\n00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:09,360\r\nSin usar la palabra apartheid porque\r\n\r\n267\r\n00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:12,560\r\nEstá en el léxico\r\n\r\n268\r\n00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:15,300\r\nY el problema está mucho más a la luz.\r\n\r\n269\r\n00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:17,220\r\nY lo estamos mirando más y más\r\n\r\n270\r\n00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:21,540\r\nHay más información para todos nosotros.\r\n\r\n271\r\n00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:25,320\r\nSobre eso que había entonces\r\n\r\n272\r\n00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:27,240\r\nes el trabajo que ha hecho BDS y por eso\r\n\r\n273\r\n00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:30,300\r\nHa progresado y me alegro de que así sea.\r\n\r\n274\r\n00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:31,920\r\nPorque lo que desesperadamente espero vivir\r\n\r\n275\r\n00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:33,959\r\nPara ver\r\n\r\n276\r\n00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:36,480\r\nes una tierra santa\r\n\r\n277\r\n00:11:33,959 --> 00:11:38,519\r\nNo me importa cómo se llame desde el\r\n\r\n278\r\n00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:41,279\r\nRío Jordán hasta el mar donde la gente\r\n\r\n279\r\n00:11:38,519 --> 00:11:45,839\r\nTodos tienen las mismas creencias religiosas y políticas.\r\n\r\n280\r\n00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:47,640\r\ny derechos sociales todos ellos iguales\r\n\r\n281\r\n00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:49,140\r\nY eso es lo que hago en el\r\n\r\n282\r\n00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:51,180\r\nmovimiento y tal vez deberíamos hablar de\r\n\r\n283\r\n00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:55,500\r\nalgo más porque yo\r\n\r\n284\r\n00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:57,779\r\nEstoy si me das cuerda tal vez podría\r\n\r\n285\r\n00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:59,880\r\nBueno, me encantaría darte cuerda, quiero decir.\r\n\r\n286\r\n00:11:57,779 --> 00:12:01,860\r\nLa definición de aparte es sí.\r\n\r\n287\r\n00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:04,560\r\nSí, es segregación, quiero decir, eso es.\r\n\r\n288\r\n00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:06,420\r\nsegregación claramente sí ¿qué es esto?\r\n\r\n289\r\n00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:08,820\r\nla opresión de un grupo ético por\r\n\r\n290\r\n00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:10,560\r\notro grupo étnico si para esos\r\n\r\n291\r\n00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:13,380\r\nrazones por las que están\r\n\r\n292\r\n00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:14,519\r\ngrupo étnico diferente, por lo que el Sur\r\n\r\n293\r\n00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:17,160\r\nmodelo africana\r\n\r\n294\r\n00:12:14,519 --> 00:12:19,440\r\nSe aplica claramente excepto que\r\n\r\n295\r\n00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:22,140\r\nLos sudafricanos que sobrevivieron a la\r\n\r\n296\r\n00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:24,660\r\nLas modelos sudafricanas dicen que\r\n\r\n297\r\n00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:26,700\r\nEl modelo israelí es mucho peor que el\r\n\r\n298\r\n00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:28,459\r\nLa modelo sudafricana blanca era la blanca\r\n\r\n299\r\n00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:31,800\r\nLos sudafricanos al menos intentaron construir\r\n\r\n300\r\n00:12:28,459 --> 00:12:33,660\r\nBueno, lo intentaron, invirtieron dinero.\r\n\r\n301\r\n00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:36,839\r\nPara empezar, intenta mantener el negro.\r\n\r\n302\r\n00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:39,839\r\nCotización de población que no lograron hacer\r\n\r\n303\r\n00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:41,040\r\npero tanto Desmond Tutu antes que él tristemente\r\n\r\n304\r\n00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:44,160\r\nfallecido\r\n\r\n305\r\n00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:45,839\r\nY Mandela obviamente también vinieron.\r\n\r\n306\r\n00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:48,060\r\nSalió completamente y dijo esto es mucho\r\n\r\n307\r\n00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:50,399\r\nPeor que todas las condiciones en el sur\r\n\r\n308\r\n00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:52,620\r\nÁfrica antes del apartheid, así es\r\n\r\n309\r\n00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:54,300\r\nDiscutiendo esto y teniendo compasión\r\n\r\n310\r\n00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:56,880\r\npara el juego del pueblo palestino\r\n\r\n311\r\n00:12:54,300 --> 00:13:01,200\r\nEso hizo que te categorizaran como\r\n\r\n312\r\n00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:02,940\r\nantisemita sí ¿alguien tenía y\r\n\r\n313\r\n00:13:01,200 -->

dentro\r\n\r\n1389\r\n00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:35,400\r\nEsa computadora portátil era un montón de locuras [ __ ]\r\n\r\n1390\r\n00:57:32,040 --> 00:57:37,319\r\ny es real y lo decían\r\n\r\n1391\r\n00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:40,200\r\nEsta fue desinformación rusa que\r\n\r\n1392\r\n00:57:37,319 --> 00:57:43,500\r\nSería la más descaradamente calumniosa.\r\n\r\n1393\r\n00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:45,000\r\ncosa salvajemente calumnia cosa que una\r\n\r\n1394\r\n00:57:43,500 --> 00:57:47,700\r\nRusia jamás ha actuado como lo

así que...\r\n\r\n1399\r\n00:57:56,460 --> 00:58:00,960\r\nContactos del FBI\r\n\r\n1400\r\n00:57:58,339 --> 00:58:03,380\r\nFacebook y les dice que hay\r\n\r\n1401\r\n00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:07,079\r\nVa a haber algo de desinformación rusa.\r\n\r\n1402\r\n00:58:03,380 --> 00:58:09,839\r\nde cara a las elecciones y ellos yo\r\n\r\n1403\r\n00:58:07,079 --> 00:58:11,880\r\nNo creo que haya dicho eso específicamente\r\n\r\n1404\r\n00:58:09,839 --> 00:58:14,160\r\nEsa computadora portátil era parte de ello, pero ellos\r\n\r\n1405\r\n00:58:11,880 --> 00:58:16,800\r\nSeguramente estaban insinuando eso y luego\r\n\r\n1406\r\n00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:19,380\r\nDecidieron limitar el compromiso\r\n\r\n1407\r\n00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:21,660\r\nque la gente tenía con eso que es muy\r\n\r\n1408\r\n00:58:19,380 --> 00:58:24,240\r\nvago no se que estaba diciendo\r\n\r\n1409\r\n00:58:21,660 --> 00:58:26,760\r\nCuando dijo eso pero mi perspectiva era\r\n\r\n1410\r\n00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:29,700\r\nAhora imagina si fueras él y estuvieras...\r\n\r\n1411\r\n00:58:26,760 --> 00:58:33,359\r\nejecutando algo como Facebook, estás\r\n\r\n1412\r\n00:58:29,700 --> 00:58:36,540\r\nEn primer lugar, estás increíblemente ocupado y si\r\n\r\n1413\r\n00:58:33,359 --> 00:58:38,880\r\nTienes confianza y fe en el FBI y\r\n\r\n1414\r\n00:58:36,540 --> 00:58:40,140\r\nLas agencias de

haces?\r\n\r\n1419\r\n00:58:47,460 --> 00:58:51,119\r\nBueno, no lo censuró como lo hizo Twitter.\r\n\r\n1420\r\n00:58:49,559 --> 00:58:53,640\r\nLo cual creo que es bastante atroz.\r\n\r\n1421\r\n00:58:51,119 --> 00:58:55,020\r\nPero lo que sí hizo fue limitarlo.\r\n\r\n1422\r\n00:58:53,640 --> 00:58:57,660\r\ncompromiso no se que es eso\r\n\r\n1423\r\n00:58:55,020 --> 00:58:59,220\r\nsignifica que el problema con ese término es como\r\n\r\n1424\r\n00:58:57,660 --> 00:59:01,079\r\nLimitando la interacción como ¿cómo estás?\r\n\r\n1425\r\n00:58:59,220 --> 00:59:03,900\r\nhaciendo eso que significa que me dices\r\n\r\n1426\r\n00:59:01,079 --> 00:59:07,980\r\nYo lo que haces y ellos no, ellos no lo hacen.\r\n\r\n1427\r\n00:59:03,900 --> 00:59:10,680\r\nTe cuento lo que implica lo que sea en\r\n\r\n1428\r\n00:59:07,980 --> 00:59:13,079\r\nprotocolo de participación menos limitado que ellos\r\n\r\n1429\r\n00:59:10,680 -->

podrías\r\n\r\n1432\r\n00:59:16,260 --> 00:59:20,099\r\nPon esa historia en tu página, sería genial.\r\n\r\n1433\r\n00:59:18,420 --> 00:59:22,020\r\nSimplemente limita la cantidad de personas que lo ven.\r\n\r\n1434\r\n00:59:20,099 --> 00:59:23,700\r\npero no entiendo como estas\r\n\r\n1435\r\n00:59:22,020 --> 00:59:27,059\r\nHaciendo eso como que no creo que ellos\r\n\r\n1436\r\n00:59:23,700 --> 00:59:29,880\r\nquiero revelar que bien el hecho\r\n\r\n1437\r\n00:59:27,059 --> 00:59:33,359\r\nEn mi opinión, lo que es realmente peligroso es\r\n\r\n1438\r\n00:59:29,880 --> 00:59:35,339\r\nque este idiota tenga algo que ver en\r\n\r\n1439\r\n00:59:33,359 --> 00:59:36,960\r\nDecidir qué leemos cualquiera de nosotros\r\n\r\n1440\r\n00:59:35,339 --> 00:59:39,480\r\ncualquier

quiero decir que podrías...\r\n\r\n1445\r\n00:59:46,500 --> 00:59:50,460\r\nDigamos que podría haber reglas que digan que\r\n\r\n1446\r\n00:59:48,359 --> 00:59:54,480\r\nNo puedes permitir que la gente te diga que deberías ir.\r\n\r\n1447\r\n00:59:50,460 --> 00:59:56,880\r\nsalir y asesinar niños, ¿verdad? pero pero\r\n\r\n1448\r\n00:59:54,480 --> 00:59:58,799\r\ncualquier cosa y ciertamente

01:00:45,240\r\nRealmente odio a estas personas lo suficiente como para que\r\n\r\n1468\r\n01:00:43,740 --> 01:00:47,160\r\nLa gente ahora dice que deberíamos simplemente\r\n\r\n1469\r\n01:00:45,240

en\r\n\r\n1480\r\n01:01:08,700 --> 01:01:13,260\r\nvida Tendría que buscarlo en Twitter\r\n\r\n1481\r\n01:01:10,859 --> 01:01:16,940\r\nNo tengo idea, ¿era un periodista? ¿era un

01:01:24,599\r\nQue solo para llamar la atención y los me gusta y\r\n\r\n1485\r\n01:01:23,220 --> 01:01:26,579\r\nSólo para obtener vistas porque creo que eso es\r\n\r\n1486\r\n01:01:24,599 --> 01:01:28,440\r\nUna gran parte de lo que es Twitter es como...\r\n\r\n1487\r\n01:01:26,579 --> 01:01:30,119\r\nMírame, va a decir algo.\r\n\r\n1488\r\n01:01:28,440 --> 01:01:32,160\r\nEscandaloso, bueno, sí, podrías tener razón.\r\n\r\n1489\r\n01:01:30,119 --> 01:01:34,020\r\nSobre eso y tú probablemente estoy seguro que tú\r\n\r\n1490\r\n01:01:32,160 --> 01:01:36,720\r\nTienen razón, estoy seguro de que hay muchos. Mira.\r\n\r\n1491\r\n01:01:34,020 --> 01:01:40,559\r\nEstoy involucrado en muchas de estas publicaciones.\r\n\r\n1492\r\n01:01:36,720 --> 01:01:42,780\r\nque salen y también mucho de lo que vamos a hacer\r\n\r\n1493\r\n01:01:40,559 --> 01:01:44,880\r\nPiensa qué pensará la gente de mí.\r\n\r\n1494\r\n01:01:42,780 --> 01:01:46,799\r\nes el todo si lo piensas todo\r\n\r\n1495\r\n01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:48,720\r\nDe esto si todo se desarrolló a partir de la\r\n\r\n1496\r\n01:01:46,799 --> 01:01:50,760\r\nInicios de Facebook y para qué\r\n\r\n1497\r\n01:01:48,720 --> 01:01:54,359\r\nCualquiera que fuera ese sitio que Zuckerberg\r\n\r\n1498\r\n01:01:50,760 --> 01:01:56,579\r\nEmpecé calificando a los estudiantes mixtos, eso es algo así\r\n\r\n1499\r\n01:01:54,359 --> 01:01:58,680\r\ndel principio de ello y el fomo y\r\n\r\n1500\r\n01:01:56,579 --> 01:02:00,660\r\nEsto y aquello y enviar fotos\r\n\r\n1501\r\n01:01:58,680 --> 01:02:02,400\r\nDe ti mismo a tus amigos y cariñosos\r\n\r\n1502\r\n01:02:00,660 --> 01:02:04,680\r\nLo que piensan tus compañeros de escuela y\r\n\r\n1503\r\n01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:09,059\r\nTodo eso y estalló en\r\n\r\n1504\r\n01:02:04,680 --> 01:02:11,400\r\nalgo que es mucho mucho mucho más\r\n\r\n1505\r\n01:02:09,059 --> 01:02:14,460\r\nMás importante que lo que te diga tu madre\r\n\r\n1506\r\n01:02:11,400 --> 01:02:16,260\r\nLee todo lo que puedas para educarte.\r\n\r\n1507\r\n01:02:14,460 --> 01:02:19,020\r\nAsegúrate de saber de lo que estás hablando\r\n\r\n1508\r\n01:02:16,260 --> 01:02:20,520\r\nacerca de y hacer lo correcto que es\r\n\r\n1509\r\n01:02:19,020 --> 01:02:22,559\r\nPorque ninguno de ellos nos lo está diciendo.\r\n\r\n1510\r\n01:02:20,520 --> 01:02:24,599\r\nHaz eso, sería maravilloso si tu\r\n\r\n1511\r\n01:02:22,559 --> 01:02:26,400\r\nMamá maneja Facebook, eso sería genial.\r\n\r\n1512\r\n01:02:24,599 --> 01:02:27,839\r\nCreo que el mundo sería realmente un\r\n\r\n1513\r\n01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:29,880\r\nDefinitivamente sería un lugar mejor\r\n\r\n1514\r\n01:02:27,839 --> 01:02:31,799\r\nExcepto que ella nunca lo haría, por supuesto.\r\n\r\n1515\r\n01:02:29,880 --> 01:02:33,660\r\nPorque ella diría Roger si piensas que soy\r\n\r\n1516\r\n01:02:31,799 --> 01:02:36,299\r\nVoy a perder mi tiempo con algo así\r\n\r\n1517\r\n01:02:33,660 --> 01:02:39,299\r\nTan endeble como Facebook tienes otra\r\n\r\n1518\r\n01:02:36,299 --> 01:02:41,220\r\ncosa que viene cariño pero lo que intenté\r\n\r\n1519\r\n01:02:39,299 --> 01:02:43,140\r\nObtener de él y lo que quería intentar\r\n\r\n1520\r\n01:02:41,220 --> 01:02:45,299\r\nEntender es como es cuando\r\n\r\n1521\r\n01:02:43,140 --> 01:02:46,980\r\nCreas algo que literalmente es\r\n\r\n1522\r\n01:02:45,299 --> 01:02:48,420\r\nSolo una red social, solo eres\r\n\r\n1523\r\n01:02:46,980 --> 01:02:50,640\r\nSe supone que debería socializar con la gente.\r\n\r\n1524\r\n01:02:48,420 --> 01:02:52,859\r\ny compartir fotografías lo cual es bastante\r\n\r\n1525\r\n01:02:50,640 --> 01:02:55,440\r\ninocuo y luego se convierte en algo\r\n\r\n1526\r\n01:02:52,859 --> 01:02:57,180\r\nque pueden influir en las elecciones y en el exterior\r\n\r\n1527\r\n01:02:55,440 --> 01:02:58,799\r\nLa política y la forma en que el mundo es\r\n\r\n1528\r\n01:02:57,180 --> 01:03:02,579\r\nvistos y la forma en que se tejen las narrativas\r\n\r\n1529\r\n01:02:58,799 --> 01:03:04,260\r\nY sabes que es una tarea abrumadora y\r\n\r\n1530\r\n01:03:02,579 --> 01:03:06,180\r\nespecialmente cuando no te propusiste hacerlo\r\n\r\n1531\r\n01:03:04,260 --> 01:03:07,740\r\nque al principio ni siquiera Twitter\r\n\r\n1532\r\n01:03:06,180 --> 01:03:09,480\r\nTwitter se propuso ser simplemente algo\r\n\r\n1533\r\n01:03:07,740 --> 01:03:12,660\r\ndonde acabas de publicar oh voy a la\r\n\r\n1534\r\n01:03:09,480 --> 01:03:14,880\r\npelículas de hoy y luego se convirtió en lo que es\r\n\r\n1535\r\n01:03:12,660 --> 01:03:17,520\r\nEs ahora porque la gente se da cuenta bien de esto.\r\n\r\n1536\r\n01:03:14,880 --> 01:03:20,359\r\nes una herramienta para distribuir información y\r\n\r\n1537\r\n01:03:17,520 --> 01:03:22,680\r\nPuedes poner cualquier cosa y ya está.\r\n\r\n1538\r\n01:03:20,359 --> 01:03:24,480\r\n¿Deberíamos limitar esa información?\r\n\r\n1539\r\n01:03:22,680 --> 01:03:28,200\r\nY eso es lo que han decidido hacer.\r\n\r\n1540\r\n01:03:24,480 --> 01:03:30,480\r\nHan decidido tomar esta moraleja y\r\n\r\n1541\r\n01:03:28,200 --> 01:03:32,940\r\nposición ética e imponer su propia\r\n\r\n1542\r\n01:03:30,480 --> 01:03:36,540\r\nIdeas y lo que debería o no debería ser\r\n\r\n1543\r\n01:03:32,940 --> 01:03:38,640\r\ndijo pero todo se basa en algún momento\r\n\r\n1544\r\n01:03:36,540 --> 01:03:40,440\r\nen esa posición en la que quieren seguir\r\n\r\n1545\r\n01:03:38,640 --> 01:03:42,299\r\ncada vez más rico y más rico y más rico y\r\n\r\n1546\r\n01:03:40,440 --> 01:03:44,099\r\nQuieren que Meta sea la

mundo.\r\n\r\n1549\r\n01:03:46,400 --> 01:03:52,380\r\nEso es lo que creo que es mental.\r\n\r\n1550\r\n01:03:49,380 --> 01:03:52,380\r\naberración\r\n\r\n1551\r\n01:03:52,880 --> 01:03:57,780\r\no

desafortunadamente\r\n\r\n2009\r\n01:21:42,659 --> 01:21:49,860\r\n¿Cómo es tu proceso creativo cuando?\r\n\r\n2010\r\n01:21:46,440 --> 01:21:52,199\r\nCuando te sientas a escribir música cuando\r\n\r\n2011\r\n01:21:49,860 --> 01:21:55,679\r\nte sientas a componer canciones como\r\n\r\n2012\r\n01:21:52,199 --> 01:21:58,199\r\n¿Cómo se hace eso?\r\n\r\n2013\r\n01:21:55,679 --> 01:22:00,780\r\nSiempre solía decirlo durante años y años.\r\n\r\n2014\r\n01:21:58,199 --> 01:22:02,940\r\nYo solía hacerlo, no lo hago o yo\r\n\r\n2015\r\n01:22:00,780 --> 01:22:05,820\r\nNo lo he hecho en el pasado\r\n\r\n2016\r\n01:22:02,940 --> 01:22:08,940\r\nEn el pasado mi respuesta siempre sería yo\r\n\r\n2017\r\n01:22:05,820 --> 01:22:10,440\r\nNo hagas nada hasta que me quede embarazada\r\n\r\n2018\r\n01:22:08,940 --> 01:22:14,159\r\nsentimiento\r\n\r\n2019\r\n01:22:10,440 --> 01:22:16,140\r\ny no puedo describir el sentimiento excepto\r\n\r\n2020\r\n01:22:14,159 --> 01:22:18,300\r\nque sé que estoy a punto de dar a luz\r\n\r\n2021\r\n01:22:16,140 --> 01:22:21,960\r\nA algo que sea lo más cercano que pueda.\r\n\r\n2022\r\n01:22:18,300 --> 01:22:25,140\r\nEntiendo que es una especie de cosa extraña\r\n\r\n2023\r\n01:22:21,960 --> 01:22:27,659\r\nniebla de la nada que se siente como si\r\n\r\n2024\r\n01:22:25,140 --> 01:22:30,060\r\nPodría aclararse y podría ver algo o\r\n\r\n2025\r\n01:22:27,659 --> 01:22:33,060\r\nAlgo podría salir a la luz muy a menudo.\r\n\r\n2026\r\n01:22:30,060 --> 01:22:35,219\r\nDespués de eso me metí en una\r\n\r\n2027\r\n01:22:33,060 --> 01:22:38,640\r\nfísicamente en la misma habitación que una guitarra\r\n\r\n2028\r\n01:22:35,219 --> 01:22:39,659\r\no un piano y con un bloc de notas y un\r\n\r\n2029\r\n01:22:38,640 --> 01:22:42,420\r\ncarretilla\r\n\r\n2030\r\n01:22:39,659 --> 01:22:44,400\r\nY ¡listo!, a veces algo aparece.\r\n\r\n2031\r\n01:22:42,420 --> 01:22:46,860\r\nSalgo y digo oh, eso es interesante y\r\n\r\n2032\r\n01:22:44,400 --> 01:22:49,320\r\nLuego trabajé en ello más recientemente cuando\r\n\r\n2033\r\n01:22:46,860 --> 01:22:51,659\r\nCuando me pasó el COVID hice dos cosas: una\r\n\r\n2034\r\n01:22:49,320 --> 01:22:54,179\r\nescribió algunas canciones que estaban en ebullición\r\n\r\n2035\r\n01:22:51,659 --> 01:22:56,580\r\nUn poco y eso podría ser solo un\r\n\r\n2036\r\n01:22:54,179 --> 01:22:58,500\r\npequeño riff de guitarra o una secuencia de acordes\r\n\r\n2037\r\n01:22:56,580 --> 01:23:00,179\r\no algo así y luego podría tocarlo\r\n\r\n2038\r\n01:22:58,500 --> 01:23:02,820\r\ny luego\r\n\r\n2039\r\n01:23:00,179 --> 01:23:06,360\r\nMi cerebro es un elogio muy fértil para\r\n\r\n2040\r\n01:23:02,820 --> 01:23:09,060\r\nIdeas y para letras y para\r\n\r\n2041\r\n01:23:06,360 --> 01:23:11,159\r\nLas letras de The Way se combinan con fragmentos de\r\n\r\n2042\r\n01:23:09,060 --> 01:23:13,739\r\nMúsica, así que me sale con bastante facilidad.\r\n\r\n2043\r\n01:23:11,159 --> 01:23:16,080\r\nUna vez que tuve una primera idea, hice eso.\r\n\r\n2044\r\n01:23:13,739 --> 01:23:16,800\r\npero también yo\r\n\r\n2045\r\n01:23:16,080 --> 01:23:18,360\r\nuno\r\n\r\n2046\r\n01:23:16,800 --> 01:23:20,100\r\nPensé\r\n\r\n2047\r\n01:23:18,360 --> 01:23:22,560\r\nTengo un par de años de esto.\r\n\r\n2048\r\n01:23:20,100 --> 01:23:25,320\r\nHe estado pensando en escribir unas memorias\r\n\r\n2049\r\n01:23:22,560 --> 01:23:27,600\r\nAsí que lo voy a hacer ahora\r\n\r\n2050\r\n01:23:25,320 --> 01:23:30,060\r\nAsí que un día saqué esto y fui.\r\n\r\n2051\r\n01:23:27,600 --> 01:23:33,480\r\nBueno, vamos con su nuevo ladrillo.\r\n\r\n2052\r\n01:23:30,060 --> 01:23:35,520\r\nAdelante, entonces, Vlogs inteligentes, así que abrí uno.\r\n\r\n2053\r\n01:23:33,480 --> 01:23:37,860\r\nDocumento de Word y fui\r\n\r\n2054\r\n01:23:35,520 --> 01:23:40,020\r\nY comencé a escribir y antes de darme cuenta\r\n\r\n2055\r\n01:23:37,860 --> 01:23:42,719\r\nHabía escrito 10.000 palabras y fui\r\n\r\n2056\r\n01:23:40,020 --> 01:23:45,179\r\nY probablemente estaba un poco borracho y entonces yo\r\n\r\n2057\r\n01:23:42,719 --> 01:23:48,120\r\nFui oh y volví un par de días\r\n\r\n2058\r\n01:23:45,179 --> 01:23:50,940\r\nMás tarde y pensé: \"Maldita sea, es prosa\".\r\n\r\n2059\r\n01:23:48,120 --> 01:23:53,580\r\ny es bastante divertido pero es profundo como\r\n\r\n2060\r\n01:23:50,940 --> 01:23:56,280\r\nBueno, y en realidad es bastante conmovedor.\r\n\r\n2061\r\n01:23:53,580 --> 01:23:59,040\r\nY entonces tuve un momento Eureka, ¿sabes?\r\n\r\n2062\r\n01:23:56,280 --> 01:24:01,440\r\nfui [ __ ] yo podría escribir Pro
