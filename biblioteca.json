Crazy week, right?\n\n21\n00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:58,320\n>> It's an incredible week for Nvidia.\n\n22\n00:00:56,559 --> 00:01:00,079\nYeah, it's crazy week. I think the um\n\n23\n00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:04,000\nwell, first of all, I it hasn't really\n\n24\n00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:06,560\nsunk in yet. Um but let's see what\n\n25\n00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,159\nthoughts comes to mind. Well, you know,\n\n26\n00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:11,280\nin a lot of ways, somebody asked me\n\n27\n00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:14,640\nyesterday about and and and mentioned to\n\n28\n00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:16,320\nme uh that I'm an immigrant, and in\n\n29\n00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,960\nfact, I am an immigrant. Talking about\n\n30\n00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,000\nimmigration,\n\n31\n00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:19,600\n>> same here.\n\n32\n00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,439\n>> And the two of us are both immigrants.\n\n33\n00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:26,000\nAnd and uh America stands for\n\n34\n00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:27,680\nthe uh the land of the American dream.\n\n35\n00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,080\nAnd this is the place where immigrants\n\n36\n00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:32,880\ncome to to build build a life and build\n\n37\n00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:34,720\na company. In a lot of ways, you know,\n\n38\n00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:36,159\nwhat I'm experiencing is probably the\n\n39\n00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,759\nultimate American dream.\n\n40\n00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:39,280\n>> Absolutely. you know, to come come to\n\n41\n00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:41,840\nUnited States when I was seven years\n\n42\n00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:43,439\nold, not I guess eight years old and and\n\n43\n00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:45,439\num\n\n44\n00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:48,240\nand and having the opportunity to found\n\n45\n00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:53,119\na company with good friends 33 years\n\n46\n00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:56,240\nago, be the uh the CEO today after 33\n\n47\n00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:58,240\nyears and um having many of the founders\n\n48\n00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:00,960\nthat are that were there with me at the\n\n49\n00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:02,960\nvery beginning still here at NVIDIA um\n\n50\n00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:05,280\npursuing a dream that we've had that\n\n51\n00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:06,640\nthat took three decades to accomplish\n\n52\n00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,520\n>> with a lot of ups and downs. with\n\n53\n00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:12,319\nenormous amount of ups and downs and you\n\n54\n00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:15,440\nknow so in a lot of ways uh this\n\n55\n00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:16,959\nmilestone what is happening to us it's\n\n56\n00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:20,000\nkind of hard to internalize it's kind of\n\n57\n00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:21,680\nhard to take in but it also represents\n\n58\n00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,080\nsomething that's really important you\n\n59\n00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:27,120\nknow we uh we wanted to reinvent the\n\n60\n00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:28,800\ncomputer the computer as we know it uh\n\n61\n00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,800\nreally has been largely defined for\n\n62\n00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:34,959\nabout six decades since the IBM system\n\n63\n00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:36,720\n360 IBM as you know was was uh the the\n\n64\n00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:40,239\nlargest company in the world of of their\n\n65\n00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:43,040\ntime and and the blueprint that they put\n\n66\n00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:44,480\ntogether for computing was basically\n\n67\n00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:47,360\nit's the same blueprint that has been\n\n68\n00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:49,360\nplayed out in the last six decades.\n\n69\n00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:51,599\nEverything from the architecture of the\n\n70\n00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:54,400\nsystems, the way the separation between\n\n71\n00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:57,280\nsoftware and hardware and architecture\n\n72\n00:02:54,400 --> 00:03:00,080\ncompatibility and you know application\n\n73\n00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:01,680\ncompatibility, full family lineup, you\n\n74\n00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:04,959\nknow, all of the things that they they\n\n75\n00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:07,120\ndescribed uh largely describes the the\n\n76\n00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:09,360\ncomputer industry today and and in order\n\n77\n00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:12,000\nand the opportunity to reinvent that and\n\n78\n00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:14,159\ntake it to the next level and now being\n\n79\n00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,319\nthe platform for artificial intelligence\n\n80\n00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:17,840\nis really a dream come true.\n\n81\n00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:20,800\nYeah, really extraordinary time.\n\n82\n00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:23,200\n>> You talk about the AI waves\n\n83\n00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:24,560\n>> and I and I really like how you divide\n\n84\n00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,959\nthem into different categories.\n\n85\n00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,840\n>> Yeah.\n\n86\n00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:31,360\n>> Can you describe where we're today in in\n\n87\n00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:35,280\nterms of the wave and how we got here?\n\n88\n00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:37,599\n>> Um 20 2012 uh uh we saw the same moment\n\n89\n00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:40,799\nas everybody else. We had the we had the\n\n90\n00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:42,319\nthe inside track in the sense that uh we\n\n91\n00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:44,640\nalways believed that CUDA was going to\n\n92\n00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:47,200\nenable a new class of applications and\n\n93\n00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:50,799\nwe were always looking out for it. And\n\n94\n00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:53,120\nso when when um Alexet came along um\n\n95\n00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:56,640\nbuilt on top of CUDA, our GPUs made it\n\n96\n00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:59,120\npossible uh to train AlexNet and for\n\n97\n00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:01,599\nAlex Net to achieve such extraordinary\n\n98\n00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:04,879\nresults in computer vision, achieve the\n\n99\n00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:07,120\nlevel of capability that um computer\n\n100\n00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:09,120\nscientists specializing in computer\n\n101\n00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:11,760\nvision could not achieve over four\n\n102\n00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:15,200\ndecades. You know, for three people to\n\n103\n00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:17,919\nto do something like that. um uh it's\n\n104\n00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:20,000\njust an extraordinary feat. And so we\n\n105\n00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:21,680\ntook the opportunity and we we looked at\n\n106\n00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,680\nwhat is it that we're looking at? You\n\n107\n00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:26,240\nknow, what what's going on here? Is this\n\n108\n00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:29,360\nis Alec Alex al Alexnet a breakthrough\n\n109\n00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:31,440\nin computer vision or is it a bigger\n\n110\n00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:34,080\nidea than that? And of course, as we\n\n111\n00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:36,080\nknow, computer vision is a pillar of\n\n112\n00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:37,680\nartificial intelligence. You know,\n\n113\n00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:39,280\nwithout computer vision, without speech\n\n114\n00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,840\nlanguage understanding, it's hard to\n\n115\n00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:43,520\nhave intelligence. And and so we we\n\n116\n00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:45,440\nrealized that this of course was a part\n\n117\n00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,880\nof artificial intelligence. But is it a\n\n118\n00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:49,840\nbigger idea than that? And we came to\n\n119\n00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:53,680\nthe conclusion that what AlexNet and\n\n120\n00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:56,880\ndeep learning showed is that it is now\n\n121\n00:04:53,680 --> 00:05:00,000\nfinally possible if we had enough data,\n\n122\n00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:01,600\nenough computing scale. And of course we\n\n123\n00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,520\nhave these deep learning models that are\n\n124\n00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:07,039\nquite scalable\n\n125\n00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:10,000\num that we might be able to apply\n\n126\n00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:12,240\ncomputers to solve problems uh that were\n\n127\n00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,720\nimpossible to describe using human\n\n128\n00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:17,280\nengineered feature and using principled\n\n129\n00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:19,360\nalgorithms. And so we we um we got\n\n130\n00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:21,039\nexcited from that perspective. We also\n\n131\n00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:23,840\ngot excited because\n\n132\n00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:26,400\n>> because when you when you reason through\n\n133\n00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:29,280\num deep learning and and the training of\n\n134\n00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:31,199\nAlexNet and where it could go, we\n\n135\n00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:32,400\nrealized that the entire computing\n\n136\n00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:34,160\nplatform is going to change,\n\n137\n00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:35,680\n>> right? processors are going to change,\n\n138\n00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:37,600\nthe internet connect's going to change,\n\n139\n00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:39,440\nthe networking is going to change, the\n\n140\n00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:41,759\nsoftware stack on top of it, how you\n\n141\n00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:44,080\ndevelop the software, the methodology of\n\n142\n00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:46,080\nsoftware inside companies and of course\n\n143\n00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:48,000\nthe many industries that we might be\n\n144\n00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:50,479\nable to create was going to completely\n\n145\n00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:53,440\nchange and so we went about doing that.\n\n146\n00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:54,800\nWe re reset our company essentially. Now\n\n147\n00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:58,240\nthe the waves that you were talking\n\n148\n00:05:54,800 --> 00:06:00,639\nabout after we did that um we dedicated\n\n149\n00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:02,639\nourselves to uh creating new libraries\n\n150\n00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:05,759\ncalled KDNN\n\n151\n00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:09,520\nuh creating creating uh AI frameworks uh\n\n152\n00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:12,639\ncalled Mega Core um Megatron core uh to\n\n153\n00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:15,680\nuh inventing MVLink and tensor cores and\n\n154\n00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:17,840\nthe different numerical formats and uh\n\n155\n00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:21,199\nwe led to uh the creation of a system we\n\n156\n00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:23,039\ncall DGX1 our first AI supercomput. I\n\n157\n00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:24,400\npersonally delivered it to a startup in\n\n158\n00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:27,919\nSan Francisco which turned out to have\n\n159\n00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:30,560\nbeen open AI and and so anyways that\n\n160\n00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:33,199\njourney uh could really be captured in\n\n161\n00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:36,160\nseveral ways. Since 2012, the first\n\n162\n00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:38,160\nthing that happened, AI took off. Uh,\n\n163\n00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:39,840\ndeep learning kept advancing. The amount\n\n164\n00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:42,479\nof data we had, the amount of compute we\n\n165\n00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:44,240\nhad kept growing, kept scaling. And it\n\n166\n00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:47,680\nled to the first wave, which is really\n\n167\n00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:49,440\ndescribed as, if I could, perception. We\n\n168\n00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:50,479\nwe solved perception. It became\n\n169\n00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:52,240\nsuperhuman.\n\n170\n00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:54,319\n>> Computer vision became superhuman.\n\n171\n00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:56,800\nLanguage understanding or speech\n\n172\n00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:58,960\nrecognition became superhuman. The\n\n173\n00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,560\nsecond the second phase is uh\n\n174\n00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:03,919\ngenerative.\n\n175\n00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:06,560\nuh we can now not only understand\n\n176\n00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:09,199\ninformation but we can translate and\n\n177\n00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:11,120\ngenerate information.

Not only did the\n\n358\n00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:33,920\nenergy production was a large industry\n\n359\n00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:35,519\nin itself creating these power\n\n360\n00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:38,399\ngeneration plants of all different types\n\n361\n00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:41,440\nall around the world, it also enabled\n\n362\n00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:45,279\nnew applications. Electricity enabled\n\n363\n00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:48,320\nlight bulbs, dishwashers, refrigerators,\n\n364\n00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:50,480\nright? Laundry machines, all kinds of\n\n365\n00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:52,240\nnew applications were created and all\n\n366\n00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:54,399\nthose applications created a new\n\n367\n00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:57,199\nindustry, created jobs.\n\n368\n00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:59,279\nNow the last industrial revolution which\n\n369\n00:14:57,199 --> 00:15:03,040\nUnited States is you know right in the\n\n370\n00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:06,079\nmiddle of was the information industrial\n\n371\n00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:08,639\nrevolution and that digital revolution\n\n372\n00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:12,000\nenabled productivity to grow in the last\n\n373\n00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:14,560\nthree decades or so productivity has\n\n374\n00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:17,360\ngrown about 80%.\n\n375\n00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:20,160\nAlong with it employment went up by 80%.\n\n376\n00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:23,360\nAnd so so when productivity goes up\n\n377\n00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:25,120\nemployment goes up. Now why is that?\n\n378\n00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:27,760\nIn fact, you could say that when\n\n379\n00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:30,079\nproductivity goes up, employment would\n\n380\n00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:33,199\ngo down because you could do more with\n\n381\n00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:36,000\nfewer people, right? But that's because\n\n382\n00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:37,839\nthat lacks imagination.\n\n383\n00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,160\nIf your company, let's just take it from\n\n384\n00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:43,120\na company's perspective. If a company\n\n385\n00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:46,399\nhas no new ideas and it's literally\n\n386\n00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:48,480\ndoing one thing and one thing only, when\n\n387\n00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:50,720\nour productivity goes up, we need fewer\n\n388\n00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:53,120\npeople to do it. But if you look at\n\n389\n00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:54,800\nNvidia, we have so many ideas. is we\n\n390\n00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:58,880\ndon't have enough time or people to go\n\n391\n00:15:54,800 --> 00:16:01,519\ndo it. The backlog of great ideas that\n\n392\n00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:03,519\nwe would love to go try\n\n393\n00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:05,839\nnew markets and new applications we like\n\n394\n00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:07,360\nto go create the backlog of that is\n\n395\n00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:09,839\nincredible.\n\n396\n00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:12,160\nNow, if I just had more people, more\n\n397\n00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:13,680\ntime, you know, considering how fast how\n\n398\n00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:15,360\nhow hard we're already working, I'm\n\n399\n00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:17,040\nalready working. If I just had more\n\n400\n00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:19,680\npeople, if I had more time, if I were\n\n401\n00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:21,040\nmore productive, we do more. Our company\n\n402\n00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:23,120\nwould be able to offer more things,\n\n403\n00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:25,600\nwould be be able to invent new ideas\n\n404\n00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:27,839\nthat created new industries. And so the\n\n405\n00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:31,519\nthe real the real theme is that are you\n\n406\n00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:34,320\na do you do you are you a hopeful person\n\n407\n00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:37,839\noptimistic person and you believe in in\n\n408\n00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:39,680\nidea creation or are you somebody who\n\n409\n00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:41,199\nbelieves you know there are no new ideas\n\n410\n00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:44,000\nleft\n\n411\n00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:46,320\nand quite frankly we're just working and\n\n412\n00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,959\nif we could just do that work more\n\n413\n00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:50,959\nproductively we'll be out of work right\n\n414\n00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:53,759\nI don't I think there's so much work to\n\n415\n00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:55,600\ndo there are so many ideas to pursue\n\n416\n00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:58,320\nthat if If I can do work more\n\n417\n00:16:55,600 --> 00:17:02,160\neffectively, I would simply do more. And\n\n418\n00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:06,640\nso I think that that that that\n\n419\n00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:07,600\noptimistic view is not naive. It's\n\n420\n00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,240\nactually history,\n\n421\n00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:10,720\n>> right?\n\n422\n00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:13,280\n>> History would suggest that humanity has\n\n423\n00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:15,839\na lot more ideas to go pursue. We have a\n\n424\n00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:17,839\nlot more challenges to go address. If we\n\n425\n00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:21,199\nshould just have more productivity, we\n\n426\n00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:23,360\ncan go get to it much faster. Well, we\n\n427\n00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:24,959\none one thing if I could just one thing\n\n428\n00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:27,520\nthat I would like to add\n\n429\n00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:29,360\n>> and this is this is um this is something\n\n430\n00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:30,799\nthat that you and I have spoken about\n\n431\n00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:36,000\nbefore.\n\n432\n00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:37,840\n>> Um it is vital that everyone engages AI\n\n433\n00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,000\nright away.\n\n434\n00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:42,080\nEvery adult,\n\n435\n00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,880\nevery working person, not working\n\n436\n00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:46,559\nperson, every child should address and\n\n437\n00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:49,120\nengage AI right away. And the reason for\n\n438\n00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:51,360\nthat is because AI is the greatest\n\n439\n00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:52,160\nequalization equalizing force.\n\n440\n00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:54,960\n>> That's a good point.\n\n441\n00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:58,080\n>> It is the first time in history that a\n\n442\n00:17:54,960 --> 00:18:01,840\ntechnology as incredible as artificial\n\n443\n00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:04,240\nintelligence is useful for someone who\n\n444\n00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:07,600\nknows how to program software, whether\n\n445\n00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:08,960\nyou program C++ or Python or you have no\n\n446\n00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:11,039\nidea how to use a computer.\n\n447\n00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:12,880\n>> Right?

If you don't\n\n450\n00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:19,360\nknow how to use AI, just open up the\n\n451\n00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:20,160\nwebsite, go to Chad GPT, go to Gemini\n\n452\n00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,960\nPro, just say\n\n453\n00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,760\n>> ask a simple question.\n\n454\n00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:24,000\n>> Yeah.

It's going to be super rough. We\n\n529\n00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:01,679\nhave an opportunity with 6G, right?\n\n530\n00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:04,559\n>> Because 6G. That's right. Because of AI\n\n531\n00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:06,799\nalso. And so we are going to go do our\n\n532\n00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:07,919\nbest to help our country regain\n\n533\n00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:10,880\ntechnology leadership and\n\n534\n00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:13,360\ntelecommunications. But back on AI, he\n\n535\n00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:15,520\nwants he wants America to uh be the\n\n536\n00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:17,840\nworld's best. Of course, he wants her\n\n537\n00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:21,120\nwould to continue to lead the world. In\n\n538\n00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:23,600\norder to lead the world in AI because AI\n\n539\n00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:25,039\nis fundamentally about computing and\n\n540\n00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:26,720\ncomputing is fundamentally about\n\n541\n00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:29,440\ndevelopers.\n\n542\n00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:33,039\nThe first job of leadership of a\n\n543\n00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:36,000\ncomputing platform which AI is also is\n\n544\n00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:38,640\nto win all developers.\n\n545\n00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:41,360\nThe first job of any platform is to win\n\n546\n00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:43,600\nall developers. Later when we talk about\n\n547\n00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:46,320\n5G, I can show you exactly the same\n\n548\n00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:48,880\nthing. We had a policy that caused us to\n\n549\n00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:51,120\nlose all developers. We need to have a\n\n550\n00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:53,919\npolicy that enables us to win all\n\n551\n00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:56,799\ndevelopers. 50% of the world's AI\n\n552\n00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:59,120\ndevelopers are in China.\n\n553\n00:21:56,799 --> 00:22:01,520\nAI developers are all over the world.\n\n554\n00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:04,880\nTheir AI developers now come out growing\n\n555\n00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:07,440\nup in Africa, in Latin America, in\n\n556\n00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:09,280\nSoutheast Asia, in the Middle East. AI\n\n557\n00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:11,360\ndevelopers are everywhere. The reason\n\n558\n00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:14,559\nwhy AI developers are everywhere is\n\n559\n00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:17,120\nbecause every country, every industry,\n\n560\n00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:18,799\nevery company needs to have intelligence\n\n561\n00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:21,520\nand wants to engage artificial\n\n562\n00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:23,679\nintelligence. But it starts with 50% are\n\n563\n00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:25,360\nin China and we need to win those\n\n564\n00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:28,880\ndevelopers. And so I think the first\n\n565\n00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:31,280\nthing he that that I would I would um\n\n566\n00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:33,120\ncontinue to say every time I I can\n\n567\n00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:36,559\nbecause the technology is not easy to\n\n568\n00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:39,520\nunderstand is if we want America to lead\n\n569\n00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:42,240\nthe AI revolution and continue to be the\n\n570\n00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:45,360\nworld leader the first thing we need is\n\n571\n00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:47,919\nevery AI developer to build on American\n\n572\n00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:48,480\ntech stack. The second thing I would say\n\n573\n00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:50,960\nis that\n\n574\n00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:53,280\n>> I think you've also said\n\n575\n00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:54,559\num you want to set the global standard\n\n576\n00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:55,919\nfor the technology stack.\n\n577\n00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:58,480\n>> That's right. The American company\n\n578\n00:22:55,919 --> 00:23:00,159\nshould be those that set the standard.\n\n579\n00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:01,200\n>> The American tech stack should be the\n\n580\n00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:03,120\nglobal standard.\n\n581\n00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:05,600\n>> Just as the American dollar is the\n\n582\n00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:08,880\nglobal standard by which every country\n\n583\n00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:11,520\nbuilds on, we should want the American\n\n584\n00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:15,919\ntech stack to be the tech stack that the\n\n585\n00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:17,840\nAI stack that everyone builds on. Now\n\n586\n00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:20,720\nthe tech stack starts with chips and\n\n587\n00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:22,960\nsystems. It is not just the AI models on\n\n588\n00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:25,360\ntop. There are many AI models on top.\n\n589\n00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:26,640\nThere's incredible models of all kinds.\n\n590\n00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:29,440\nSome of them are open source, some of\n\n591\n00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:32,080\nthem are closed, some of for physics,\n\n592\n00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:34,799\nsome of them are for uh quantum, some of\n\n593\n00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:37,520\nthem are for communications. The AI\n\n594\n00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:39,600\nmodels are of all different types. The\n\n595\n00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:42,320\nthings that you do uh your initiative\n\n596\n00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:44,000\ncalled AI plus I just deeply love. AI\n\n597\n00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:46,880\nfor science, that model is obviously\n\n598\n00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:50,159\ndifferent than a chatbot. AI for quantum\n\n599\n00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:52,159\nobviously different. AI for 5G and 6G,\n\n600\n00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:53,919\nobviously different, right? And so AI\n\n601\n00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:57,360\nfor robotics, obviously different. And\n\n602\n00:23:53,919 --> 00:24:00,480\nso all these different models are all AI\n\n603\n00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:03,120\nmodels and they should all be built\n\n604\n00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:04,960\n>> on the American tech stack. And so the\n\n605\n00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:10,320\nsecond thing that I would advocate is\n\n606\n00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:13,600\nthat AI diffusion should not be to limit\n\n607\n00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:16,480\nAmerican tech stack to the world. AI\n\n608\n00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:19,039\ndiffusion should be about maximizing the\n\n609\n00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:21,520\nAmerican tech stack all over the world\n\n610\n00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:24,480\nso that every AI developer in the world\n\n611\n00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:26,880\nbuilds on the American standard. And as\n\n612\n00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:30,240\nwe know about the computing ecosystem,\n\n613\n00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:33,600\nthe virtual cycle is incredible. the\n\n614\n00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:35,760\nmore your technology is everywhere, the\n\n615\n00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:37,440\nmore developers you're gonna have, the\n\n616\n00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:38,880\nmore developers you're going to have,\n\n617\n00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:40,400\nthe more your technology is going to be\n\n618\n00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:41,679\neverywhere. And so this positive\n\n619\n00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:43,279\nfeedback system is\n\n620\n00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:45,840\n>> I will just piggyback on this topic\n\n621\n00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:46,320\nbecause you talk a lot about sovereign\n\n622\n00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:47,120\nAI.\n\n623\n00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:49,840\n>> Yeah.\n\n624\n00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:52,159\n>> What do you mean by that? How does a\n\n625\n00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:54,640\ncountry build a sovereign AI? Why does\n\n626\n00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:56,720\nit need it for? You know, obviously the\n\n627\n00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:58,240\nway Europeans will build sovereign AI is\n\n628\n00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:00,159\ngoing to be different than how African\n\n629\n00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:02,240\ncountries are big. But you're traveling\n\n630\n00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:04,159\naround the world and advocating for\n\n631\n00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:05,120\nsovereign AI. So can you unpack your\n\n632\n00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:07,200\nvision about this?\n\n633\n00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:09,919\n>> I'm advocating for the American tech\n\n634\n00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:11,919\nstack to be the tech stack that every\n\n635\n00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:14,080\ncountry builds on. That's what I'm\n\n636\n00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:15,520\nadvocating for. And the reason the\n\n637\n00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:17,840\nreason why every country needs to build\n\n638\n00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:19,279\ntheir own tech stack, their own AI, is\n\n639\n00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:20,960\nbecause even though they could use\n\n640\n00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:23,919\nAmerican AIS, there's no question. And\n\n641\n00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:26,159\nthey should um every country should use\n\n642\n00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:29,520\nOpen AI. Every c country should use\n\n643\n00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:31,440\nGemini. um Google's Gemini and every\n\n644\n00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:34,240\ncountry should use Grock, you know, and\n\n645\n00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:36,640\nand so these are incredible models and\n\n646\n00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:38,799\nso every country should use them, but\n\n647\n00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:42,080\nthey should also build their own\n\n648\n00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:44,960\nindigenous AI stack and their AI AI\n\n649\n00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:47,600\nmodels and that AI model is trained on\n\n650\n00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:49,520\ntheir language, their history, their the\n\n651\n00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:52,480\nknowledge of their society, their\n\n652\n00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:55,279\nculture, their values. It's not sensible\n\n653\n00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:58,240\nthat one western company will be able to\n\n654\n00:25:55,279 --> 00:26:00,559\ncapture and somehow appre deeply\n\n655\n00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:02,640\nappreciate the values of every country\n\n656\n00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:04,799\nand every religion and every background\n\n657\n00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:07,039\nand every you know society around the\n\n658\n00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:09,120\nworld. And so each one of them should be\n\n659\n00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:11,919\nable to build something on their own.\n\n660\n00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:14,559\nAnd that AI model will work with other\n\n661\n00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:18,240\nindustrial AI open AI models or maybe\n\n662\n00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:20,240\neven private um uh corporate models or\n\n663\n00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:22,640\nyou know specific\n\n664\n00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:24,799\nindustrial science models or whatever it\n\n665\n00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:26,159\nis. But all of these models are going to\n\n666\n00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:28,480\ninteract. They should be able to build\n\n667\n00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:29,919\ntheir own and but still we want them to\n\n668\n00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:32,080\nbuild on American tech stack.\n\n669\n00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:34,480\n>> Yeah. You've been pretty vocal about the\n\n670\n00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:36,640\nUS China tech competition. So I want to\n\n671\n00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:38,080\nget your views about how you view the\n\n672\n00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:40,000\ncompetition. you call them a peer\n\n673\n00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:41,919\ncompetitor, not a nearper but a peer\n\n674\n00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,760\ncompetitor that have serious products,\n\n675\n00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:47,200\nserious companies. Where do you think\n\n676\n00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:52,559\nthe competition stands now?\n\n677\n00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:55,840\nUm f first of all uh China is our\n\n678\n00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:57,600\ncompetitor and adversary not our enemy.\n\n679\n00:26:55,840 --> 00:27:00,559\nAnd the reason for that is because we\n\n680\n00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:02,159\nhave we have deep interconnections and\n\n681\n00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:04,960\ninterdependencies between the two\n\n682\n00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:08,240\ncountries.\n\n683\n00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:10,400\nAmerica is incredible. Our\n\n684\n00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:12,720\ntechnology leadership\n\n685\n00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:14,400\nis extraordinary.\n\n686\n00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:17,440\nThe computer industry by which I have\n\n687\n00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:20,400\nthe honor to serve\n\n688\n00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:24,000\nis the most talented, deeply capable\n\n689\n00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:27,200\ntech industry the world's ever seen.\n\n690\n00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:29,760\nAnd I expect us to retain\n\n691\n00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:33,360\nour leadership position for decades to\n\n692\n00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:36,799\ncome. And I welcome competition.\n\n693\n00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:39,520\nLet's go. you know, competitors, come\n\n694\n00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:42,640\non, let's go play. That's the American\n\n695\n00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:46,799\nspirit. The the competitive spirit that\n\n696\n00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:49,200\nwe have um isn't lost.\n\n697\n00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:53,120\nAnd we need the opportunity as the\n\n698\n00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:55,440\nAmerican industry to go fight for\n\n699\n00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:59,039\nAmerican leadership.\n\n700\n00:27:55,440 --> 00:28:01,840\nAnd at a time when when\n\n701\n00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:03,840\ncompanies countries around the world all\n\n702\n00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:06,320\nhave capabilities, frankly, we're\n\n703\n00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:08,480\ninterdependent and we depend on the\n\n704\n00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:10,320\ncapabilities of many countries. You\n\n705\n00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:12,480\nknow, the deeper you go, the more you\n\n706\n00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:14,080\nrealized, you realize there are things\n\n707\n00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:16,399\nin Europe that we depend on. There are\n\n708\n00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:17,919\nthings in in Japan we depend on. There\n\n709\n00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:19,600\nare things in Southeast Asia we depend\n\n710\n00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:21,840\non. There's things in Latin America we\n\n711\n00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:24,320\ndepend on. You know, every country has\n\n712\n00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:26,399\ntheir specialty and their capabilities.\n\n713\n00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:28,559\nAnd China of course has formidable\n\n714\n00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:31,279\ncapabilities. Their technology companies\n\n715\n00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:33,679\nare formidable. Huawei is formidable.\n\n716\n00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:38,159\nBYD is formidable. These are incredible\n\n717\n00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:41,440\ncompanies. Their their\n\n718\n00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:47,279\nnational pride in manufacturing\n\n719\n00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:49,760\nand uh deep really deep and broad you\n\n720\n00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:51,760\nknow scale of manufacturing expertise\n\n721\n00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:54,640\ncan be undermined. It's not about labor.\n\n722\n00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:55,039\nIt's technology plus craft and labor\n\n723\n00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:55,520\nscale,\n\n724\n00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:57,279\n>> right?\n\n725\n00:28:55,520 --> 00:29:00,080\n>> The combination of those three things\n\n726\n00:28:57,279 --> 00:29:03,279\ntogether is just extraordinary. It's\n\n727\n00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:06,799\nit's something to to witness. And so we\n\n728\n00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:10,159\nwe need to realize that that um we are\n\n729\n00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:12,480\nnow in a interdependent world. Uh and so\n\n730\n00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:15,760\nwhat do we do? uh the things that we\n\n731\n00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:18,000\nshould do uh one\n\n732\n00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:20,080\nwhat President Trump's\n\n733\n00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:24,960\ninitiative President Trump's initiative\n\n734\n00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:30,080\non uh localizing or re reindustrializing\n\n735\n00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:33,919\nAmerica is just a fantastic and and\n\n736\n00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:36,480\nvisionary and timely initiative. We need\n\n737\n00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:38,960\nto we need to be world class at the\n\n738\n00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:41,120\ntechnology of manufacturing, the craft\n\n739\n00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:43,760\nof manufacturing and the labor scale of\n\n740\n00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:46,640\nmanufacturing. Again, that entire part\n\n741\n00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:49,279\nof our ecosystem is somewhat lagging and\n\n742\n00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:51,200\nwe've lost our passion for it. Uh maybe\n\n743\n00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:52,960\nit's not it maybe it's because back in\n\n744\n00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:55,679\nthe old days it was more about labor\n\n745\n00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:57,840\nthan it was about technology. Um but now\n\n746\n00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:59,600\nit's deeply technical and it's something\n\n747\n00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:02,559\nthat we could really get passionate\n\n748\n00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:04,960\nbehind. And so I I think this whole area\n\n749\n00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:07,760\nof manufacturing so that we could reduce\n\n750\n00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:10,480\nour dependency on many countries around\n\n751\n00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:12,880\nthe world reduce the temperature there\n\n752\n00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:14,640\num have more capabilities ourselves.\n\n753\n00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:16,559\nIt's great for our national security.\n\n754\n00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:20,080\nIt's great for our industries. It's\n\n755\n00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:22,399\ngreat for um for job creation. It's\n\n756\n00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:24,799\ngreat for our culture, frankly. It's\n\n757\n00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:26,880\ngreat for our society overall. And so I\n\n758\n00:30:24,799 --> 00:30:29,360\nI love that vision, President Trump's\n\n759\n00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:31,760\nvision of re-industrializing America.\n\n760\n00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:33,279\nAnd so I think that we need to do that.\n\n761\n00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:35,440\nMeanwhile,\n\n762\n00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:38,880\nwe have to get extra we have to stay\n\n763\n00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:41,600\nextraordinarily excellent in uh areas\n\n764\n00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:44,240\nlike artificial intelligence and and AI\n\n765\n00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:47,440\ncomputing and and the the tech stack so\n\n766\n00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:51,440\nthat we could be a partner to every\n\n767\n00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:53,360\ncountry in the world and um uh and and\n\n768\n00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:56,000\nmake a contribution to every country in\n\n769\n00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:58,159\nthe world so that we could have uh this\n\n770\n00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:01,200\ncontinued you know interdependency of\n\n771\n00:30:58,159 --> 00:31:02,640\neach other and uh uh you know drive our\n\n772\n00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:04,559\nindustry straight forward.\n\n773\n00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:07,279\n>> Last question. Jensen, you talk about\n\n774\n00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:10,640\nregaining strategic confidence. Is this\n\n775\n00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:12,960\nwhat that means in your words, leading,\n\n776\n00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:16,480\nkeep inventing? And by this end of this\n\n777\n00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:18,240\ndecade, American technologies have built\n\n778\n00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:20,399\nthe global infrastructure both on the\n\n779\n00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:20,880\ntech stack hardware, but as well as\n\n780\n00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:22,960\nsoftware.\n\n781\n00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:25,600\n>> Yeah, exactly. you know, most of the\n\n782\n00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:27,200\ntime most of the time regulation um\n\n783\n00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:31,520\npolicies\n\n784\n00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:34,640\nuh uh tends to be tends to tends to\n\n785\n00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:36,559\nfocus too much on limiting and\n\n786\n00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:38,720\nrestricting.\n\n787\n00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:42,640\nUm and that that's that is that is fine\n\n788\n00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:46,320\nto do. Um, I just want to remind remind\n\n789\n00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:47,840\nuh ourselves that America is\n\n790\n00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:50,000\nextraordinary\n\n791\n00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:51,360\nand that the companies here and I I have\n\n792\n00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,440\nthe benefit of working with companies\n\n793\n00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:55,279\nall over the world. Nvidia is obviously\n\n794\n00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:57,600\na global company. We have we have\n\n795\n00:31:55,279 --> 00:32:00,080\nbusinesses all over the world. Um, I can\n\n796\n00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:03,600\nattest that this country is\n\n797\n00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:06,640\nextraordinary has extraordinary\n\n798\n00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:12,399\nwork ethics. Frankly, I think Americans\n\n799\n00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:15,440\nwork, if not as hard as any hardworking\n\n800\n00:32:12,399 --> 00:32:16,960\nculture in the world, but I consider\n\n801\n00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:19,279\nmany American companies and many\n\n802\n00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:22,480\nindustries, we work the hardest of any\n\n803\n00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:25,840\nindustry. And so so Americans work, we\n\n804\n00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:29,039\nhave work ethics, we have incredible\n\n805\n00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:30,559\num uh\n\n806\n00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:32,480\nfoundation\n\n807\n00:32:30,559 --> 00:32:36,000\nuh for supporting industry and\n\n808\n00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:38,480\nsupporting startups. And uh it's a it's\n\n809\n00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,840\nstill the world's best place for\n\n810\n00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:41,519\nimmigrants to come.\n\n811\n00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:43,120\n>> Yeah.\n\n812\n00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:44,880\nIt's still the world's best place for\n\n813\n00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:47,840\nimmigrants to come to get a great\n\n814\n00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:50,320\neducation and have the opportunity with\n\n815\n00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:53,919\nall the ecosystem around us to build a\n\n816\n00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:56,080\ngreat company. I saw it firsthand.\n\n817\n00:32:53,919 --> 00:32:59,120\nYou know, no one has enjoyed the\n\n818\n00:32:56,080 --> 00:33:01,039\nAmerican dream and saw it personally in\n\n819\n00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:03,919\nmy lifetime\n\n820\n00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:06,080\nthan I have. You know, if if there's a\n\n821\n00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:07,919\nbook that's called the American dream,\n\n822\n00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:10,399\nI'm I might be one of the chapters,\n\n823\n00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:12,960\nright? you know, and so so this is this\n\n824\n00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:16,880\nis I embody the American dream and and\n\n825\n00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:21,840\nso I I I walk with extraordinary pride\n\n826\n00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:24,399\nand great and gratitude um and uh uh and\n\n827\n00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:28,880\nrecognizing what the magic of the of\n\n828\n00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:32,640\nAmerica and uh and also uh a great\n\n829\n00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:35,360\nconfidence about what we can do and and\n\n830\n00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:38,320\nso I think that that whatever policies\n\n831\n00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:41,039\nare created are developed\n\n832\n00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:42,640\nis to realize, you know, and this is no\n\n833\n00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:44,480\ndifferent than than companies developing\n\n834\n00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:46,960\nstrategies. Before you develop\n\n835\n00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:49,039\nstrategies about the adversary or the\n\n836\n00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:52,159\ncompetition, the first thing you have to\n\n837\n00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:55,120\ndo is know thyself.\n\n838\n00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:58,559\nAnd the the strategies that you deploy\n\n839\n00:33:55,120 --> 00:34:00,720\nwhen you're in defense versus the\n\n840\n00:33:58,559 --> 00:34:04,480\nstrategies that you deploy and policies\n\n841\n00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:06,880\nyou deploy when you are in offense are\n\n842\n00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:08,879\nrelated, not the same. And so it's\n\n843\n00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:11,280\nreally important to s get a sense of\n\n844\n00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:14,560\nwhat our what our national capabilities\n\n845\n00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:17,359\nare and especially in the field of\n\n846\n00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:19,440\nartificial intelligence and computing uh\n\n847\n00:34:17,359 --> 00:34:21,440\nto recognize what an extraordinary\n\n848\n00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:24,879\nindustry we've created somehow over the\n\n849\n00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:27,679\nyears and it is our national treasure.\n\n850\n00:34:24,879 --> 00:34:31,200\nWe should do everything we can to\n\n851\n00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:33,440\nfurther this capability to nurture this\n\n852\n00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:36,560\ncapability to protect this capability\n\n853\n00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:38,240\nand enhance it.

Y entonces nosotros\n\n105\n00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:21,680\naproveché la oportunidad y nos miramos\n\n106\n00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,680\n¿Qué es lo que estamos mirando? Tú\n\n107\n00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:26,240\n¿Sabes qué está pasando aquí?

Y por supuesto, como nosotros\n\n111\n00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:36,080\nYa sabes, la visión por computadora es un pilar de\n\n112\n00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:37,680\ninteligencia artificial. Sabes,\n\n113\n00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:39,280\nsin visión por computadora, sin habla\n\n114\n00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,840\ncomprensión del idioma, es difícil\n\n115\n00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:43,520\ntener inteligencia. Y entonces nosotros nosotros\n\n116\n00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:45,440\nMe di cuenta de que esto, por supuesto, era parte\n\n117\n00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,880\nde inteligencia artificial. ¿Pero es un\n\n118\n00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:49,840\n¿Una idea más grande que esa? Y llegamos a\n\n119\n00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:53,680\nla conclusión de que lo que AlexNet y\n\n120\n00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:56,880\nEl aprendizaje profundo demostró es que ahora es\n\n121\n00:04:53,680 --> 00:05:00,000\nfinalmente posible si tuviéramos suficientes datos,\n\n122\n00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:01,600\nsuficiente escala informática. Y por supuesto nosotros\n\n123\n00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,520\ntener estos modelos de aprendizaje profundo que son\n\n124\n00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:07,039\nbastante escalable\n\n125\n00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:10,000\num que podríamos ser capaces de aplicar\n\n126\n00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:12,240\ncomputadoras para resolver problemas uh que eran\n\n127\n00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,720\nimposible de describir usando humanos\n\n128\n00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:17,280\ncaracterística diseñada y utilizando principios\n\n129\n00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:19,360\nalgoritmos.

Debido a la IA\n\n531\n00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:06,799\ntambién. Y entonces vamos a hacer nuestro\n\n532\n00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:07,919\nmejor para ayudar a nuestro país a recuperarse\n\n533\n00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:10,880\nliderazgo tecnológico y\n\n534\n00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:13,360\ntelecomunicaciones. Pero volviendo a la IA, él\n\n535\n00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:15,520\nquiere que Estados Unidos sea el\n\n536\n00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:17,840\nlos mejores del mundo. Por supuesto, él la quiere.\n\n537\n00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:21,120\ncontinuaría liderando el mundo. En\n\n538\n00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:23,600\npara liderar el mundo en IA porque la IA\n\n539\n00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:25,039\ntrata fundamentalmente de informática y\n\n540\n00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:26,720\nLa informática se trata fundamentalmente de\n\n541\n00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:29,440\ndesarrolladores.\n\n542\n00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:33,039\nEl primer trabajo de liderazgo de una\n\n543\n00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:36,000\nplataforma informática que también es la IA\n\n544\n00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:38,640\npara ganar a todos los desarrolladores.\n\n545\n00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:41,360\nEl primer trabajo de cualquier plataforma es ganar\n\n546\n00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:43,600\ntodos los desarrolladores. Más tarde cuando hablamos de\n\n547\n00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:46,320\n5G, puedo mostrarte exactamente lo mismo\n\n548\n00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:48,880\ncosa. Teníamos una política que nos hizo\n\n549\n00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:51,120\nperder a todos los desarrolladores. Necesitamos tener un\n\n550\n00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:53,919\npolítica que nos permita ganarlo todo\n\n551\n00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:56,799\ndesarrolladores. 50% de la IA del mundo\n\n552\n00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:59,120\nLos desarrolladores están en China.\n\n553\n00:21:56,799 --> 00:22:01,520\nLos desarrolladores de IA están en todo el mundo.\n\n554\n00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:04,880\nSus desarrolladores de IA ahora están creciendo\n\n555\n00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:07,440\nen África, en América Latina, en\n\n556\n00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:09,280\nSudeste Asiático, en Medio Oriente. AI\n\n557\n00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:11,360\nLos desarrolladores están en todas partes. La razón\n\n558\n00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:14,559\nLa razón por la que los desarrolladores de IA están en todas partes es\n\n559\n00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:17,120\nporque cada país, cada industria,\n\n560\n00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:18,799\ntoda empresa necesita tener inteligencia\n\n561\n00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:21,520\ny quiere involucrarse artificial\n\n562\n00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:23,679\ninteligencia. Pero comienza con el 50% son\n\n563\n00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:25,360\nen China y necesitamos ganar esos\n\n564\n00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:28,880\ndesarrolladores. Y entonces creo que la primera\n\n565\n00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:31,280\ncosa el que eso lo haría lo haría um\n\n566\n00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:33,120\nsigo diciendo cada vez que puedo\n\n567\n00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:36,559\nporque la tecnología no es fácil de\n\n568\n00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:39,520\nentender es si queremos que Estados Unidos lidere\n\n569\n00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:42,240\nla revolución de la IA y seguir siendo el\n\n570\n00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:45,360\nlíder mundial lo primero que necesitamos es\n\n571\n00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:47,919\ncada desarrollador de IA se base en Estados Unidos\n\n572\n00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:48,480\npila de tecnología. La segunda cosa que diría\n\n573\n00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:50,960\nes eso\n\n574\n00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:53,280\n>> Creo que también has dicho\n\n575\n00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:54,559\num quieres establecer el estándar global\n\n576\n00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:55,919\npara la pila de tecnología.\n\n577\n00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:58,480\n>> Así es. la empresa americana\n\n578\n00:22:55,919 --> 00:23:00,159\ndeberían ser aquellos que establezcan la norma.\n\n579\n00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:01,200\n>> La pila tecnológica estadounidense debería ser la\n\n580\n00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:03,120\nestándar mundial.\n\n581\n00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:05,600\n>> Así como el dólar americano es el\n\n582\n00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:08,880\nestándar global por el cual cada país\n\n583\n00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:11,520\nse basa en, deberíamos querer que los estadounidenses\n\n584\n00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:15,919\npila de tecnología para ser la pila de tecnología que el\n\n585\n00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:17,840\nPila de IA sobre la que todos construyen. Ahora\n\n586\n00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:20,720\nla pila tecnológica comienza con chips y\n\n587\n00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:22,960\nsistemas. No se trata sólo de los modelos de IA\n\n588\n00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:25,360\narriba. Hay muchos modelos de IA además.\n\n589\n00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:26,640\nHay modelos increíbles de todo tipo.\n\n590\n00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:29,440\nAlgunos de ellos son de código abierto, otros\n\n591\n00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:32,080\nestán cerrados, algunos de física,\n\n592\n00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:34,799\nalgunos de ellos son para uh cuánticos, algunos de\n\n593\n00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:37,520\nSon para comunicaciones. La IA\n\n594\n00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:39,600\nLos modelos son de todos los tipos diferentes. El\n\n595\n00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:42,320\ncosas que haces uh tu iniciativa\n\n596\n00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:44,000\nSe llama AI plus y me encanta. AI\n\n597\n00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:46,880\npara la ciencia, ese modelo es obviamente\n\n598\n00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:50,159\ndiferente a un chatbot. IA para lo cuántico\n\n599\n00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:52,159\nobviamente diferente. IA para 5G y 6G,\n\n600\n00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:53,919\nobviamente diferente, ¿verdad? Y entonces la IA\n\n601\n00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:57,360\npara la robótica, obviamente diferente. Y\n\n602\n00:23:53,919 --> 00:24:00,480\nentonces todos estos modelos diferentes son todos IA\n\n603\n00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:03,120\nmodelos y todos deberían ser construidos\n\n604\n00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:04,960\n>> en la pila tecnológica estadounidense. Y así el\n\n605\n00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:10,320\nLa segunda cosa que recomendaría es\n\n606\n00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:13,600\nque la difusión de la IA no debería limitarse\n\n607\n00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:16,480\nPila de tecnología estadounidense para el mundo. AI\n\n608\n00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:19,039\nLa difusión debe consistir en maximizar la\n\n609\n00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:21,520\nPila de tecnología estadounidense en todo el mundo\n\n610\n00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:24,480\npara que todos los desarrolladores de IA del mundo\n\n611\n00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:26,880\nse basa en el estándar americano. y como\n\n612\n00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:30,240\nsabemos sobre el ecosistema informático,\n\n613\n00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:33,600\nEl ciclo virtual es increíble. el\n\n614\n00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:35,760\nCuanto más tu tecnología esté en todas partes, más\n\n615\n00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:37,440\nmás desarrolladores tendrás, el\n\n616\n00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:38,880\nmás desarrolladores vas a tener,\n\n617\n00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:40,400\ncuanto más será tu tecnología\n\n618\n00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:41,679\nen todos lados. Y entonces esto positivo\n\n619\n00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:43,279\nEl sistema de retroalimentación es\n\n620\n00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:45,840\n>> Me limitaré a aprovechar este tema\n\n621\n00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:46,320\nporque hablas mucho de soberano\n\n622\n00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:47,120\nAI.\n\n623\n00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:49,840\n>> Sí.\n\n624\n00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:52,159\n>> ¿Qué quieres decir con eso? ¿Cómo funciona un\n\n625\n00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:54,640\n¿Qué país construirá una IA soberana? ¿Por qué\n\n626\n00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:56,720\n¿Lo necesita? Ya sabes, obviamente el\n\n627\n00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:58,240\nLa forma en que los europeos construirán una IA soberana es\n\n628\n00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:00,159\nva a ser diferente de lo africano\n\n629\n00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:02,240\nLos países son grandes. pero estás viajando\n\n630\n00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:04,159\nen todo el mundo y abogar por\n\n631\n00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:05,120\nIA soberana. Entonces, ¿puedes desempacar tu\n\n632\n00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:07,200\nvisión sobre esto?\n\n633\n00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:09,919\n>> Estoy defendiendo la tecnología estadounidense\n\n634\n00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:11,919\npila para ser la pila tecnológica que cada\n\n635\n00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:14,080\nel país sigue construyendo. eso es lo que soy\n\n636\n00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:15,520\nabogando por.
