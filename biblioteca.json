naivety in those\n\n438\n00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:03,199\nfirst songs which is it's kind of\n\n439\n00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:06,319\nstunning because it's so simple and\n\n440\n00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:08,079\nso direct um\n\n441\n00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:10,319\nand you know he's like almost like\n\n442\n00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:12,480\nnothing else in a way it's like\n\n443\n00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:13,839\ni know some people say it's influential\n\n444\n00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:16,400\nbut in a way no one's\n\n445\n00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:18,319\nreally been able to imitate it because\n\n446\n00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:21,280\nit seems so unique you know\n\n447\n00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:22,319\nyeah at the time it probably didn't feel\n\n448\n00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:25,600\nlike there was particularly\n\n449\n00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:26,319\nanything special there well one though i\n\n450\n00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:29,520\nthink it did\n\n451\n00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:31,840\nyou know i think a lot of it\n\n452\n00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:33,760\num i mean maybe a lot of the associate\n\n453\n00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:36,240\nthe the associations became\n\n454\n00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:37,280\nthey were always odd and they became\n\n455\n00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:40,559\nmore bizarre\n\n456\n00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:41,280\nyou know as time went by but if you take\n\n457\n00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:48,240\nsome of the\n\n458\n00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:48,240\nsongs off the of the first album um\n\n459\n00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:51,520\nit's interesting that i had a couple of\n\n460\n00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:53,280\nsongs on the first album as well it's\n\n461\n00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:55,360\ninteresting that\n\n462\n00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:56,960\neven my preoccupations were beginning to\n\n463\n00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:58,640\nappear in that there's a song called\n\n464\n00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,960\ncorporal clegg on the first album which\n\n465\n00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:02,160\nis\n\n466\n00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:03,760\nsort of you know there's my sort of\n\n467\n00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:06,960\nlife's work right there in that one\n\n468\n00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:10,480\nlittle kind of beginning but with sid\n\n469\n00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:11,360\num you know bike i think is an\n\n470\n00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,720\nextraordinary\n\n471\n00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:16,080\nwell there were a lot there were lots of\n\n472\n00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:18,720\ngreat songs on that first album in that\n\n473\n00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:19,840\nparticular style that he developed but\n\n474\n00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:21,600\nit was the way\n\n475\n00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:23,120\nyou know part of what was good was the\n\n476\n00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:25,520\nway that he allowed them\n\n477\n00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:26,799\nuh the lyric and the rhythm to attach to\n\n478\n00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:29,840\none another\n\n479\n00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:29,840\nin a way that\n\n480\n00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:34,559\num was quite was both poetic and musical\n\n481\n00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,080\nyou know\n\n482\n00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:37,919\ni've got a bite you can ride it if you\n\n483\n00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:39,440\nlike it's got a basket but all the rings\n\n484\n00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:40,960\nand things to make it look good\n\n485\n00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:43,600\ni'd give it to you if i could but i\n\n486\n00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:46,000\nborrowed it\n\n487\n00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:48,240\nthere's something away about the way the\n\n488\n00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:50,799\nlyric attaches to the meter in a very\n\n489\n00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:53,120\nsatisfying way but then that gets\n\n490\n00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:54,960\nbut i borrowed it kind of kicks it off\n\n491\n00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:56,480\ninto\n\n492\n00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:59,360\nthere's something very english about\n\n493\n00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:02,000\nthat about the completeness of that\n\n494\n00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:03,360\nand yet the fact that it's so\n\n495\n00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,919\nunpredictable i think it was the\n\n496\n00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:08,840\nunpredictability of it combined with um\n\n497\n00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:10,720\nits simplicity that that made it so\n\n498\n00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:14,160\nspecial it's almost like\n\n499\n00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:14,559\nhe's it's like a conversation about a\n\n500\n00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:17,520\nbike\n\n501\n00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:19,840\nit's it's uh there's nothing kind of\n\n502\n00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:22,080\nstaged or\n\n503\n00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:23,679\nuh sort of crafted about in this in one\n\n504\n00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:26,160\nsense\n\n505\n00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:28,480\nyou know it seems so just absolutely\n\n506\n00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:30,160\nit's very painterly\n\n507\n00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:31,679\nit's very painterly it's like you know i\n\n508\n00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,960\nremember a painting he didn't go to a\n\n509\n00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:35,679\ngreat friend of ours\n\n510\n00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:37,120\ncalled adrian taylor who was a lawyer no\n\n511\n00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:38,000\nthey bought it they bought it off him\n\n512\n00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:40,320\nand it was a picture\n\n513\n00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,600\nof um christians and lions or just lions\n\n514\n00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:44,640\nin the coliseum\n\n515\n00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:47,679\nand he got an arched um\n\n516\n00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:48,720\ntemplate mask and laid it across the\n\n517\n00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:50,960\nthing and\n\n518\n00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:52,640\nor sprayed it or drew around it and then\n\n519\n00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:54,160\ndid it another way like that so you got\n\n520\n00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:55,200\nthis strange perspective so it's a\n\n521\n00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,720\ndevice\n\n522\n00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:59,200\nyou know he was g he was good at\n\n523\n00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:02,320\nspotting how to use devices\n\n524\n00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:06,320\nin a in a kind of meaningful way\n\n525\n00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:09,600\ni think and i think the construction of\n\n526\n00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:12,240\nthe songs was in some way\n\n527\n00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:12,960\nbut kind of painterly if i can use that\n\n528\n00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:15,600\nadjective\n\n529\n00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:16,559\nif it exists yeah yeah no i think if it\n\n530\n00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:20,159\nmeans anything\n\n531\n00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:24,000\nit's a good one actually yeah it's\n\n532\n00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:27,039\nuh you can always this is sort of\n\n533\n00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:29,200\nthe strokes i mean it's not um geometric\n\n534\n00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:29,200\nor\n\n535\n00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:36,159\nnot like a mathematician putting me\n\n536\n00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:38,400\ntake a couple if you wish they're on the\n\n537\n00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:40,559\ndish you know that that kind of\n\n538\n00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:42,880\nalliteration as well which is very\n\n539\n00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:49,600\nchildhood childish\n\n540\n00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:51,120\nbut is also um\n\n541\n00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:54,000\ni'm not sure why it moves us there must\n\n542\n00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:54,000\nbe a reason you know\n\n543\n00:20:54,720 --> 00:21:00,720\nuh why those songs were as good as they\n\n544\n00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:00,720\nare\n\n545\n00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:06,320\nand then in a way

it\n\n642\n00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:26,880\nreally well of course because he's got\n\n643\n00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:30,159\ngreat voice\n\n644\n00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:34,640\nand it was very

on\n\n651\n00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:48,960\nreally it's a very short period of time\n\n652\n00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:52,080\nthere's quite a few songs there\n\n653\n00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:54,960\nsort of am i right well i don't i don't\n\n654\n00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:58,159\nthink he's got very much on there\n\n655\n00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:59,840\ni got this uh piper\n\n656\n00:24:58,159 -->

just from i mean if you think i was\n\n662\n00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:18,799\nthinking of\n\n663\n00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:20,080\narnold arnold lane is like very and that\n\n664\n00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:21,120\nisn't on there but i know it's that\n\n665\n00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:24,320\nperiod\n\n666\n00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:26,080\nit's like a very um a new kind of pop\n\n667\n00:25:24,320 -->

songwriting with bike\n\n674\n00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:46,960\nyou know it's a great spectrum in one\n\n675\n00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:49,440\none album um\n\n676\n00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:50,320\nit gets so quick so fast you know such a\n\n677\n00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,840\nconcentrated\n\n678\n00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:55,360\nshort period well i'm not sure that it\n\n679\n00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:57,919\nis you see because like all first albums\n\n680\n00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:59,200\nall first albums of any artist or any\n\n681\n00:25:57,919 --> 00:26:02,559\nband

00:26:10,159\nwhatever so i mean i i don't have a very\n\n685\n00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:12,480\nclear memory of the chronology of\n\n686\n00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:14,320\nof that period of sid's writing but\n\n687\n00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:15,760\nbecause it was the first album my\n\n688\n00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:17,760\nsuspicion is that they\n\n689\n00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:19,360\nactually those songs were probably\n\n690\n00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:21,200\nwritten between you know\n\n691\n00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:22,559\nover a period of two or three years\n\n692\n00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:25,679\nrather than\n\n693\n00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:28,799\nover a period of six months\n\n694\n00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:31,120\nthat would be my guess well\n\n695\n00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:32,400\nat what point did it all start to go\n\n696\n00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:34,799\nwrong\n\n697\n00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:36,400\nfor you and for sid i mean obviously\n\n698\n00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:38,080\nthere was\n\n699\n00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:40,320\ndrug taking but um that must have been\n\n700\n00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:42,880\ngoing on generally\n\n701\n00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:44,559\nwhat point did it start to seem like\n\n702\n00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:45,200\nwell it may have well have been going on\n\n703\n00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:47,279\ngenerally i\n\n704\n00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:48,559\nwasn't i mean i wasn't doing any drugs\n\n705\n00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:52,159\nat all\n\n706\n00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:55,760\napart from alcohol right um\n\n707\n00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:56,480\nuh sid was i think yeah quite a lot but\n\n708\n00:26:55,760 --> 00:27:00,320\ni i mean i\n\n709\n00:26:56,480 --> 00:27:00,320\ni think sid's illness\n\n710\n00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:06,320\nit probably you know we we can say that\n\n711\n00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:09,440\num\n\n712\n00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:11,679\nmarijuana to a certain extent\n\n713\n00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:13,039\nan acid to a large extent can do nothing\n\n714\n00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:15,679\nbut exacerbate\n\n715\n00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:17,360\nuh that collection of symptoms that we\n\n716\n00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:19,679\nput together and loosely describe as\n\n717\n00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:22,880\nschizophrenia you know\n\n718\n00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:25,200\nand so um there is no doubt\n\n719\n00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:26,559\nbut that

idea\n\n1301\n00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:26,800\nyou know because he can't he can't allow\n\n1302\n00:49:25,359 --> 00:49:29,440\nthe fact that it might be something to\n\n1303\n00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:33,599\ndo with what the record's about\n\n1304\n00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:36,160\nbut i think it is i mean obviously the\n\n1305\n00:49:33,599 --> 00:49:37,920\nyou know there that's how the moon is\n\n1306\n00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:41,599\nquite compelling musically\n\n1307\n00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:44,640\nyou know and it and it's got some\n\n1308\n00:49:41,599 --> 00:49:47,280\nsome terrific uh

--> 00:49:54,640\nthe shape of the thing and also and and\n\n1312\n00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:56,960\nalso\n\n1313\n00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:58,559\nthe sound of the music and what it is i\n\n1314\n00:49:56,960 --> 00:50:01,520\nactually springs\n\n1315\n00:49:58,559 --> 00:50:04,800\nthe wellspring is the expression of the\n\n1316\n00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:06,880\nemotion which is actually in the lyric\n\n1317\n00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:08,079\nbeca and and it you know it's it's funny\n\n1318\n00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:08,720\nyou should say that because there's\n\n1319\n00:50:08,079 --> 00:50:12,319\nsomething\n\n1320\n00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:15,280\ni and maybe i learned this from sid\n\n1321\n00:50:12,319 --> 00:50:17,119\nthere's something about um breathe\n\n1322\n00:50:15,280

which\n\n1325\n00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:24,240\nis so simplistic and sort of\n\n1326\n00:50:21,599 --> 00:50:25,680\npure aisle that it would be very easy to\n\n1327\n00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:26,640\nwrite it down on a piece of paper and\n\n1328\n00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:28,160\nthen immediately\n\n1329\n00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:30,000\ncrumble it up and throw it in the

it's\n\n1333\n00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:38,160\nreally important that you don't throw\n\n1334\n00:50:36,319 --> 00:50:41,280\nthat stuff in the bin that you keep it\n\n1335\n00:50:38,160 -->

mí.\r\n\r\n73\r\n00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:45,680\r\nAsí que él era un Hank Marvin, sí, absolutamente.\r\n\r\n74\r\n00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:50,720\r\nSí, él estaba donde tú eh\r\n\r\n75\r\n00:02:50,720

llama\r\n\r\n464\r\n00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,640\r\ncabo clegg en el primer álbum que\r\n\r\n465\r\n00:17:58,640 --> 00:17:58,960\r\nes\r\n\r\n466\r\n00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:02,160\r\nalgo así como ya sabes ahí está mi tipo de\r\n\r\n467\r\n00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,760\r\nEl trabajo de la vida está ahí mismo, en ese\r\n\r\n468\r\n00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:06,960\r\npequeño tipo de comienzo pero con sid\r\n\r\n469\r\n00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:10,480\r\nUm, sabes, creo que la bicicleta es una\r\n\r\n470\r\n00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:11,360\r\nextraordinario\r\n\r\n471\r\n00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,720\r\nBueno, había muchos, había muchos.\r\n\r\n472\r\n00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:16,080\r\nGrandes canciones en ese primer álbum en ese\r\n\r\n473\r\n00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,720\r\nestilo particular que desarrolló pero\r\n\r\n474\r\n00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:19,840\r\nAsí era\r\n\r\n475\r\n00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,600\r\nSabes que parte de lo bueno fue la\r\n\r\n476\r\n00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,120\r\nforma en que les permitió\r\n\r\n477\r\n00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:25,520\r\nuh la letra y el ritmo para adjuntarlo\r\n\r\n478\r\n00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:26,799\r\nunos y otros\r\n\r\n479\r\n00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:29,840\r\nde una manera que\r\n\r\n480\r\n00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:34,000\r\num era bastante poético y musical.\r\n\r\n481\r\n00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:34,559\r\nsabes\r\n\r\n482\r\n00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:36,080\r\nTengo un mordisco, puedes montarlo si quieres.\r\n\r\n483\r\n00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,919\r\ncomo si tuviera una canasta pero todos los anillos\r\n\r\n484\r\n00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:39,440\r\ny cosas para que se vea bien\r\n\r\n485\r\n00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:40,960\r\nTe lo daría si pudiera pero yo\r\n\r\n486\r\n00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:43,600\r\nlo tomé prestado\r\n\r\n487\r\n00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:46,000\r\nHay algo extraño en la forma en que...\r\n\r\n488\r\n00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,240\r\nLa letra se adhiere al metro de una manera muy\r\n\r\n489\r\n00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,799\r\nmanera satisfactoria pero luego eso se vuelve\r\n\r\n490\r\n00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:53,120\r\nPero lo tomé prestado, como que lo pongo en marcha.\r\n\r\n491\r\n00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,960\r\nen\r\n\r\n492\r\n00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,480\r\nHay algo muy inglés en esto\r\n\r\n493\r\n00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:59,360\r\nEso sobre la integridad de eso\r\n\r\n494\r\n00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:02,000\r\nY sin embargo, el hecho de que sea así\r\n\r\n495\r\n00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,360\r\nImpredecible creo que fue el\r\n\r\n496\r\n00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:05,919\r\nSu imprevisibilidad combinada con...\r\n\r\n497\r\n00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:08,840\r\nSu simplicidad es lo que lo hizo así.\r\n\r\n498\r\n00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:10,720\r\nespecial es casi como\r\n\r\n499\r\n00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:14,160\r\nEs como una conversación sobre un\r\n\r\n500\r\n00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:14,559\r\nbicicleta\r\n\r\n501\r\n00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:17,520\r\nEs, es, eh, no hay nada de eso.\r\n\r\n502\r\n00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,840\r\npuesta en escena o\r\n\r\n503\r\n00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:22,080\r\nEh, algo así como elaborado sobre esto en uno.\r\n\r\n504\r\n00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:23,679\r\nsentido\r\n\r\n505\r\n00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:26,160\r\nSabes que parece tan absolutamente\r\n\r\n506\r\n00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,480\r\nEs muy pictórico\r\n\r\n507\r\n00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:30,160\r\nEs muy pictórico, es como si supieras que...\r\n\r\n508\r\n00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,679\r\nrecuerda un cuadro al que no fue\r\n\r\n509\r\n00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:32,960\r\ngran amigo nuestro\r\n\r\n510\r\n00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:35,679\r\nSe llamaba Adrian Taylor, que era

00:19:50,960\r\no lo rocié o dibujé alrededor y luego\r\n\r\n519\r\n00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,640\r\nLo hice de otra manera así que lo conseguiste\r\n\r\n520\r\n00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,160\r\nEsta
